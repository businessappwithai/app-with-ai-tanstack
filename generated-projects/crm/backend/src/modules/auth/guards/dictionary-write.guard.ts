/**
 * Dictionary Write Guard — reading the Application Dictionary is for everyone,
 * changing it is for administrators.
 *
 * The `/sys` controller carries `RolesGuard` but almost no `@Roles`, and
 * `RolesGuard` allows anything with no roles declared. The result was that a
 * signed-in user with no privileges could `PATCH /sys/fields/:id` or
 * `DELETE /sys/tables/:id` — and because every screen in a generated
 * application is drawn from those rows rather than from page code, editing them
 * changes what every other user sees. One ordinary account could hide a column
 * from the whole company.
 *
 * The split is not "lock the controller": ordinary screens genuinely need to
 * read the dictionary. `use-entities.ts` calls `/sys/tables`, `/sys/fields/form`
 * and `/sys/fields/grid` to render a list or a form at all, so gating reads
 * would leave a non-admin looking at empty pages. Only the writes are
 * administrative, which is the same line the frontend already draws by calling
 * reads from hooks and writes from `components/admin/*`.
 *
 * Method-based rather than a decorator on each route, deliberately: there are
 * twenty-eight write routes today and a new one added later would otherwise be
 * open by default. Here the default is closed and a route has to be a GET to be
 * public.
