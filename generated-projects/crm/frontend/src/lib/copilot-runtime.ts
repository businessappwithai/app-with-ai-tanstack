/**
 * The CopilotKit runtime behind the administrator's assistant.
 *
 * Runs in the front end server rather than the NestJS API so the chat stream
 * never crosses the proxy: CopilotKit streams over its own protocol, and
 * forwarding that through the API's request pipeline buys nothing and breaks
 * streaming. The model context the assistant reasons about still comes from the
 * API, over the ordinary endpoints, as a tool the model calls.
 *
 * Points at the same OpenAI-compatible endpoint the rest of the application is
 * configured with, so there is one base URL to repoint and one key to rotate.
 *
 * The client posts to /api/copilotkit exactly — no trailing segment — which a
 * splat route can never match, so the routing lives in the /api/$ route and
 * both shapes land here. `isCopilotPath` is what that route asks.
