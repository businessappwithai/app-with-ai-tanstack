/**
 * Forwarding /api/* to the NestJS API, from inside the front end server.
 *
 * The application is two servers, and the browser is only ever told about the
 * first one. Every /api request lands here and is replayed against the second
 * from the server side, so from the browser's point of view there is one origin
 * and one set of cookies.
 *
 * That is not a tidiness preference, it is what makes signing in work. Talking
 * to the API on its own port makes every call cross-origin: the response has to
 * carry an exact Access-Control-Allow-Origin and Access-Control-Allow-Credentials
 * for the session cookie to be stored at all, which in turn means the API has to
 * be told the browser's origin ahead of time. Get it wrong — a different host
 * name, an IP instead of localhost, a port the compose file did not predict —
 * and the sign-in request returns 200 with a perfectly good session that the
 * browser then throws away. The UI says the password is wrong. It is not.
 *
 * Same-origin has none of that: no preflight, no allow-list, no cookie
 * negotiation, and it works unchanged on localhost, on a LAN address, behind a
 * reverse proxy, and over plain HTTP.
