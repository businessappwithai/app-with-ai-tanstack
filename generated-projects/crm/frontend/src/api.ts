/**
 * The API entry point.
 *
 * This file is small but it is not optional. TanStack Start only mounts a
 * router for `src/routes/api/**` if this file exists — `defineConfig` checks for
 * it by name and silently skips the whole API router when it is missing. Without
 * it every /api/* request is handled by the page router instead, which finds no
 * page at that address and answers 200 with an HTML "Not Found" body.
 *
 * That failure is quiet in the worst way. `vinxi dev` proxies /api to the API
 * before the router ever sees it, so development works; only a built server
 * shows the problem, and it shows it as a sign-in that reports a bad password
 * while the same credentials succeed against the API directly.
 *
 * The route files it serves must export their route as `APIRoute` —
 * `createAPIFileRoute(…)` assigned to any other name is not registered.
