/**
 * Vite's asset-import suffixes, declared for TypeScript.
 *
 * `import url from './globals.css?url'` is a Vite instruction — it resolves to
 * the emitted asset's URL rather than to the stylesheet's contents — and the
 * compiler has no idea what the `?url` suffix means without this. Without the
 * declaration the root route fails to typecheck on a freshly generated app,
 * which is not a real problem with the code and reads like one.
