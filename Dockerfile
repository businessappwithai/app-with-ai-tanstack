# The APPWITHAI generator, as an image.
#
# What comes out is the design-and-generate application: sign in, bring a model,
# generate a full-stack app from it, and — at the deploy step — build that
# generated app into an image of its own.
#
# That last part is why the runtime stage carries a docker client. The container
# does not run a daemon; it talks to the host's, which means the socket has to be
# handed in:
#
#   docker run -v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock …
#
# Without it everything works except deploy, which will say so rather than fail
# obscurely.
#
# Two ways to give it a model, both handled by the entrypoint:
#
#   SEED_MODEL=/models/drug-discovery.eml.mmd   a mounted .mmd document
#   SEED_DATABASE_URL=postgres://…              an existing schema to read
#
# And one database of its own, which may be local or hosted:
#
#   DATABASE_URL=postgresql://…                 Neon and friends work as-is; TLS
#                                               is negotiated for remote hosts

# Behind a TLS-intercepting proxy — corporate egress, or a sandboxed CI runner —
# the build cannot verify any certificate until it trusts that proxy's CA. Drop
# the certificate into `docker/ca-certificates/` and it is installed in both
# stages; the directory is empty by default and the whole step is a no-op:
#
#   cp corporate-ca.crt docker/ca-certificates/
#   docker build --network host \
#     --build-arg HTTPS_PROXY="$HTTPS_PROXY" --build-arg NO_PROXY="$NO_PROXY" .
#
# ─── certificates ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
# One stage, reused by both of the real ones, so the trust store is assembled
# identically in each and the install layer is cached once.
