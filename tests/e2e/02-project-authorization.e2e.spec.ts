/**
 * Who can reach a project, and who cannot.
 *
 * This is the check the codebase cares about most — "every route touching a
 * project must call `requireProjectAccess`" — and it is the one a unit test
 * cannot make, because the thing being asserted is that *no* route was
 * forgotten. So the suite enumerates the project-scoped endpoints and drives
 * each of them as three different callers: nobody, a signed-in stranger, and
 * the owner.
 *
 * A route added later without the check fails here rather than in a report
 * somebody writes afterwards. That is not hypothetical twice over: the list's
 * first run found three endpoints serving unauthenticated callers, and adding
 * `/workflows` to it later found two more. The list is the weak part of this
 * design — a route absent from it is not tested — so it is worth extending
 * whenever a project-scoped route is added.
