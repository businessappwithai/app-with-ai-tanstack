/**
 * `erdwithai-wasm`, end to end, from the outside.
 *
 * These run the CLI as a command and read what it wrote, rather than importing
 * its functions — because every failure this suite exists to catch was a failure
 * of the whole command and not of a function: a script still saying `bun`, a
 * `.env` the built backend cannot find, an overlay quietly growing a tenth file
 * it rewrites.
 *
 * The two halves of the stack are tested differently, on purpose:
 *
 *   - **standalone** is generated *and started*, because it has no install step,
 *     so there is nothing between generating it and finding out whether it runs.
 *   - **the NestJS overlay** is generated and inspected. Actually running it
 *     means `npm install` — two thousand packages, minutes — which CI's
 *     `generated-wasm-app` job does once per commit. What this asserts instead
 *     is the contract that job cannot: exactly which files the overlay touched.
