/**
 * `%%report` directives → the reports a generated application ships with.
 *
 * `%%report` was the one directive this repository parsed and then dropped. The
 * checker read it (`language/cli/src/parser.ts`), held it to its shape and put
 * it in `model.reports`; the *generator's* parser had no case for it at all, so
 * a model carrying a hundred and thirty-six reports generated an application
 * with none — byte for byte the same application it would have generated with
 * the directives deleted. The questions were declared, validated, published in
 * the example models, and then answered by nothing.
 *
 * The reporting platform in `app-and-report-with-ai-tanstack` compiles the same
 * directive into saved queries, report definitions and charts. That is a
 * separate product, reached through its own docker-compose, and it cannot be
 * put inside a browser tab. This is the other half: the model's own questions,
 * carried into the application the model generates, answered against the
 * application's own database. Both readings come from the same directive, so a
 * model written for one is already written for the other.
 *
 * Nothing here invents a report. A model that declares none generates an
 * application whose reports section is empty, and says so.
