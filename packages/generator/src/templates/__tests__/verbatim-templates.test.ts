/**
 * Regression: a template copied verbatim carried a Handlebars token.
 *
 * `packages/generator/templates` holds two kinds of file and the difference is
 * the extension. A `.hbs` file is compiled — `{{project.name}}` becomes the
 * project's name. Everything else is copied byte for byte, by `copyFile` or by
 * `BaseGenerator.component()`, and a `{{…}}` in one of those is shipped to the
 * generated application exactly as written.
 *
 * Ten files did. Each carried `* Generated: {{now}}` in its header comment,
 * inherited from a `.hbs` sibling, so every generated application shipped ten
 * files claiming to have been generated at `{{now}}` — including
 * `src/components/layout/index.ts`, which is three lines long.
 *
 * They compiled, which is why nobody noticed: all ten sat inside block
 * comments. A token in code would have been a syntax error and would have been
 * found the first time an application was built. This is the failure mode that
 * survives — visible only to whoever opens the file.
 *
 * The tokens listed below are the generator's own vocabulary: the context keys
 * `prepareContext` builds and the block helpers the templates use. Deliberately
 * not "any `{{`": `components/automation/AutomationHelp.tsx` documents the
 * generated application's *own* reference syntax, which is spelled the same way
 * — `{{tier.discount_pct}}`, `{{L1.iteration}}` — inside string literals it is
 * meant to display. Those are content, not tokens.
