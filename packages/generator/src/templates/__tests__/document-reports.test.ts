/**
 * The per-entity document report, and the three ways it was not working.
 *
 * Every entity is seeded a printable layout, an administrator can redesign it
 * in Admin → Report Designs, and a Print button on the record renders it. All
 * three pieces were generated and none of them worked, in ways that produce no
 * error anywhere:
 *
 *   - the record screen looked a design up by the route slug (`account`) while
 *     designs are stored against the table (`bus_account`), so the lookup
 *     answered null for every business entity and the Print button never
 *     appeared;
 *   - the designer fetched its field list from `/sys/entity-metadata/:table`,
 *     a path no controller serves, so its data-source tree was empty and no
 *     field could be bound;
 *   - the seeded layout was not AnkaReport's `ILayout`. The renderer reads the
 *     layout directly and ignores anything shaped differently, so a layout
 *     with nested `style` objects, a numeric `fontSize` and no page `width`
 *     rendered as an unstyled, zero-width document.
 *
 * Each is pinned below, against the library's own contract.
