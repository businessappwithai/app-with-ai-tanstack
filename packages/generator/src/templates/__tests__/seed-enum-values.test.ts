/**
 * Regression: ISSUE-006 — the sample data ignored the model's own %%enum values.
 * Found by /qa on 2026-09-01.
 * Report: .gstack/qa-reports/qa-report-dance-studio-qa-2026-09-01.md
 *
 * `seedValue` picked a status from a hardcoded generic list — "Active",
 * "Pending", "Completed", "In Progress", "Scheduled" — for every column named
 * `status`, whatever the model said that column may hold. In the dance-studio
 * model none of those five is a declared value of MemberStatus, PackStatus,
 * BookingStatus or SessionStatus, so every seeded row held a value its own
 * application dictionary rejects.
 *
 * The consequence was not cosmetic. The generated EntityAccessGuard refuses a
 * status write with no edge out of the state the row is in, and there is no
 * edge out of "Pending" — so all four state machines the model declares were
 * dead on the data the application shipped with, and every rule keyed on a real
 * status value never fired. A freshly generated application could not
 * demonstrate the workflows it had just been generated from.
 *
 * The property worth holding is the one CLAUDE.md already states for the
 * generated test suites: assert against the model's own %%enum values, not
 * against whatever the same generator happened to write.
