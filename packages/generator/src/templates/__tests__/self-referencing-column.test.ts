/**
 * Regression: a self-referencing hierarchy column could never be written.
 *
 * `bus.service` stripped any `<entity>_id` field on create, on the assumption
 * that it is a legacy primary-key alias. For `AssetClass.asset_class_id` — a
 * real column pointing at the parent asset class — that discarded the value,
 * and the generated "reference is required" rule then refused every create:
 * "Asset Class is required". Seeded rows existed, so the list looked fine and
 * only a write failed.
 *
 * The strip must apply only when the table has no such column of its own.
 *
 * Found running the website's deployable zip under docker compose on the
 * investment-planning v1.0.1 model.
