/**
 * The sidebar's navigation search.
 *
 * A generated application's navigation is as long as its model: the hospital
 * example puts twenty-six entities in the sidebar across seven categories, and
 * finding one by scrolling is the thing this replaces. The search is entirely
 * client-side, because `/sys/categories/dashboard` has already delivered every
 * row the list is drawn from — going back to the server to filter data that is
 * in the browser would be slower and would fail offline.
 *
 * These are shape assertions on the template, which is what this repository can
 * test about a `.hbs` file; the behaviour itself — ranking, wrapping, Enter,
 * Escape — was driven in Chromium against a generated application. What they
 * protect is the set of things that are easy to delete by accident and silent
 * when gone: the combobox semantics a screen reader needs, the keys, and the
 * fact that the physical table name is searchable.
