 * runs inside a browser tab, where `node:fs` cannot be imported at all: a
 * namespace import of it at module scope fails the bundle whether or not the
 * functions using it are reachable. Everything here is pure, so both the CLI
 * and the hosted generator page get the same reading of a model from the same
 * code.
 *
 * generate-application.ts re-exports all of it, so nothing that imported these
 * from there had to change.
