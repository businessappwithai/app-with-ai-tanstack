/**
 * `%%hook` directives → generated lifecycle handlers.
 *
 * A workflow's diagram is how a reader sees the lifecycle; its `%%hook`
 * directives are what the generated application runs. The directives were being
 * stored faithfully in the model and then dropped on the floor at generation
 * time — `getHooks()` in the generated backend always returned `{}`, so a model
 * could declare `beforeCreate hashPassword on User` and the generated app would
 * silently do nothing.
 *
 * This module reads the directives, validates them against the entities the
 * model actually declares, and hands the generator a list it can turn into
 * handler modules and a registry.
 *
 * The directive is self-describing (`... on <Entity>`), so hooks are collected
 * from the whole document rather than per workflow section. A hook declared
 * outside a `%%workflow` block is still a hook.
