/**
 * The manual reports the window, the tab and the fields — and reports the ones
 * the application actually draws.
 *
 * Two defects this covers, and they are different shapes.
 *
 * The first is absence. The manual described an entity's *columns* and stopped,
 * so the layer between a column and a screen — `sys_window`, `sys_tab`,
 * `sys_field`, which is what the running application reads on every render —
 * was in the dictionary, in the database, and in no document a reader was given.
 *
 * The second is the one adding it invites. `DictionaryGenerator` marks every
 * column grid-visible and leaves each consumer to narrow it: the browser stack
 * through `isNoise`, the NestJS seed through its own `GRID_NOISE`. A manual that
 * read the derivation raw would report a list carrying `id`, `version` and the
 * four audit columns that no application shows — accurate about the dictionary
 * and wrong about the screen, which is the worse of the two failures because it
 * reads as authoritative.
 *
 * The fixture is a real published model rather than one written to match the
 * renderer, for the reason `compile-reports.test.ts` gives: a fixture that
 * matches the code proves only that the code matches itself.
