/**
 * Compiling a repeat.
 *
 * A loop is drawn as a Mermaid `subgraph`, which means its members carry no
 * sequence-flow edges of their own. That is the trap: without expanding the
 * subgraph the members are unreachable from any edge and fall through to the
 * "unwired tasks run last" pass, so a workflow compiles with no warning and
 * runs its loop body *after* everything that was supposed to follow it.
 *
 * The loop needs no BPMN element of its own — the check is flattened onto each
 * member, and the executor treats a run of consecutive equal `loopId`s as one
 * body. That keeps every workflow definition written before loops existed, and
 * every BPMN renderer, working unchanged.
