/**
 * One reading of a model, for the viewers to draw.
 *
 * `website/viewers/` renders an `.eml.mmd` while a language model is still
 * writing it: the entities and their links, the state machines, the sagas and
 * the decision flows. What it must never do is read the document its own way.
 * A viewer with its own parser is a viewer that shows an application nobody is
 * going to get — it would disagree with the generator about which columns are
 * foreign keys, which enum binding took, which transition is legal, and the
 * author would find out only after generating.
 *
 * So this composes the real ones. `parseModel` is the pipeline's own reading;
 * the section extractors and the flowchart parser are the ones the rule
 * compiler uses; `deriveAccess` is what both stacks seed their roles from.
 * Everything here beyond that is arrangement: pairing a compiled rule back to
 * the flowchart it came from, resolving which column a state machine drives,
 * counting. Nothing is re-derived.
 *
 * It is bundled to `website/viewers/eml-model.js` by `scripts/build-viewers.ts`,
 * which is why it may not touch the filesystem — see `parse-model.ts` for the
 * same constraint and the same reason.
