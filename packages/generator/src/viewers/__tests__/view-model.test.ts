/**
 * The viewers see what the generator sees.
 *
 * `readModel` composes the real parser and the real compilers, so what these
 * assert is not that a second reading agrees with the first — there is no
 * second reading — but the three things composition can still get wrong:
 *
 *   pairing      a compiled rule back to the flowchart it came from, and a
 *                compiled workflow back to the `%%meta name:` above it
 *   derivation   the column a state machine drives, the states no enum
 *                declares, the properties a step is missing
 *   tolerance    a half-written document is the normal case here, because the
 *                whole point is watching one being written. Nothing may throw
 *
 * The last of those is the one worth having: a viewer that throws on an
 * incomplete model is a viewer that goes blank at exactly the moment a reader
 * wants it, and every phase of `website/llmtext/llmdetailed.txt` ends with a
 * document that is incomplete on purpose.
