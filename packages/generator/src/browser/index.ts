/**
 * The generator, as it runs in a browser.
 *
 * This is the entry point bundled into `html/assets/erdwithai-wasm.js`, and it
 * is deliberately thin: the parsing, compiling and assembling it exposes are
 * the same functions the CLI calls, imported from the same files. There is no
 * browser edition of the compiler, which is the only way the page can promise
 * that what it generates is what `erdwithai-wasm generate` would have written.
 *
 * What it cannot import is anything reaching `node:fs` — hence `parse-model.ts`
 * being separate from `generate-application.ts`, and hence the runtime being
 * inlined by `scripts/build-wasm-runtime.ts` rather than read off disk.
