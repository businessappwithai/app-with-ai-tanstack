/**
 * The NestJS + TanStack Start stack, assembled in a browser tab.
 *
 * This is the other half of what `erdwithai-wasm generate` does — the half that
 * needed a disk. `run-in-browser.html` compiles a model into the self-contained
 * runtime, which needs no install and no build; this compiles the same model
 * into the *real* application, four hundred files of NestJS and React, for
 * something that can install and build it. In a tab, that something is a
 * WebContainer.
 *
 * Nothing here is a browser edition of the generator. `generateApplication` and
 * `applyWasmOverlay` are the same functions the CLI calls, running unmodified;
 * what changes is the filesystem underneath them, which the bundler binds to
 * `memory-fs.ts`. That is the whole trick, and it is why an application
 * assembled here is the application the command would have written rather than
 * something that resembles it.
 *
 * The templates are fetched rather than inlined. There are 1.7MB of them across
 * three hundred files, and a page that only sometimes boots a WebContainer
 * should not carry that in its JavaScript — `scripts/build-stack-templates.ts`
 * writes them beside the page as one JSON file, the way `vendor:pglite` puts
 * PostgreSQL there.
