/**
 * The workflows a model declares, for the generated application's Rules & workflows screen.
 *
 * The modelling tool reads these straight out of the EML document it is editing. A generated
 * application has no document to read, and the rows it seeds for them are compiled for the
 * engine (BPMN, edges) — the diagram an author drew is not among them. So the same sections
 * are written into the front end once, at generation time, by the same reader the modelling
 * tool uses, and the screen shows them beside the ones built in the application.
 *
 * They are the model's: the next generation rewrites them, so the screen opens the hook and
 * saga workflows read-only. A status flow opens editable: saving it stores a flow the
 * application runs in place of this one (the API's LifecycleStore).
