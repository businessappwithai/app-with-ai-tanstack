/**
 * Parent and child, from the one directive that declares it to the dictionary

 *
 * `%%entity <Child> parent: <Parent>` is the only place a model can say that an
 * entity has no life away from its owner — the ERD cannot, because
 * `InvoiceLine.invoice_id` and `Invoice.customer_id` are the same shape. What
 * the directive buys is an arrangement: no window and no dashboard card for the
 * child, a tab inside the parent's window instead, linked on the foreign key the
 * child already declared. Every assertion below is about one step of that, and
 * each of them has been silently wrong at some point:
 *
 *  - the child kept a window, so it got a dashboard card as well as a tab;
 *  - the tab was created but `link_column_id` was never set, so the detail list
 *    showed every row of the child table under every parent record;
 *  - the column was never marked `is_parent`, which is what the browser bundle
 *    and the NestJS seed both read to find the link.
 *
 * The checker half is here for the same reason: EML149 is the only thing that
 * notices an entity shaped like a line item that never says so, and a model that
 * never says so generates the arrangement this file exists to prevent.

    %%entity Customer help: An organisation the business bills. The account outlives every invoice on it, which is why a customer is never deleted while an unpaid one stands.
    %%field Customer.name help: The trading name to address on correspondence and to print on the invoice. Not necessarily the registered entity.
    %%entity Invoice help: A demand for payment issued to a customer, and the record the money is chased against. Created when work is signed off, and never edited once issued: a correction is a credit note.
    %%field Invoice.reference help: The number the customer quotes when paying. It is what a remittance is matched on, so it is issued once and never reused.
    %%field Invoice.customer_id help: The organisation being billed. It decides which payment terms apply and where the invoice is sent, and it is fixed once the invoice is issued.
    %%entity InvoiceLine parent: Invoice
    %%entity InvoiceLine help: One charge on an invoice. A line has no meaning away from its invoice — line 2 of invoice 4417, not line 2 — which is why it is a line item rather than a screen of its own.
    %%field InvoiceLine.invoice_id help: The invoice this charge belongs to. It is what the invoice's own screen lists the lines by.
    %%field InvoiceLine.description help: What is being charged for, in the words the customer will read on the document. Specific enough that they can approve it without asking.
    %%field InvoiceLine.amount help: What this line adds to the invoice, before tax. The invoice total is what these come to, so a line changed after issue changes what is owed.
