/**
 * Help text, and the three ways a model has none.
 *
 * `%%entity … help:` and `%%field … help:` are the only explanation a generated
 * application ever has: they become `sys_table.description` and
 * `sys_column.description`, the hint under the control, and the whole of the
 * "what it is for" column of `manual.html`. There is no second source — no
 * hand-written tooltip, no README beside the form — so a model that skips help
 * produces an application whose manual is a table of dashes.
 *
 * Coverage alone was not enough, which is why `EML151` exists. A published
 * model carried help on all 91 of its entities and all 551 of its columns, and
 * 699 of those lines were the column's own name in a sentence — `Household id
 * for HouseholdMember.` Every coverage check passed and the manual read as a
 * list of labels printed twice.
 *
 * The three codes are held here together because the interesting property is
 * the boundary between them: `EML151` has to fire on a template and stay quiet
 * on real help that happens to be short, or it becomes a warning nobody reads.

    %%entity Borrower help: Somebody who has borrowed, or applied to borrow. The record outlives every loan on it, because a repayment history is the main thing a second application is judged on.
    %%field Borrower.full_name help: Legal name as it appears on the identity document the application was verified against. A mismatch here is the commonest reason a disbursal is held up.
    %%field Borrower.credit_score help: The bureau score at the last pull, 300-900. It sets the rate band the borrower qualifies for, and a score pulled more than 90 days ago has to be refreshed before approval.
    %%entity Loan help: One advance of money and the obligation to repay it. A loan is created on approval rather than on application, so an application that was refused leaves no loan behind.
    %%field Loan.borrower_id help: Who owes the money. It decides whose repayment history the loan affects and who is pursued on default.
    %%field Loan.principal help: The amount advanced, before interest. Repayment schedules are derived from it, so correcting it after disbursal means reissuing the schedule.
    %%field Loan.maturity_date help: When the last instalment falls due. Past it, an unpaid loan moves to recovery, which is a different process with different authority.
