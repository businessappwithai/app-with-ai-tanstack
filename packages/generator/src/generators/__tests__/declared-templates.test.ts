/**
 * Regression: the generators named templates that were not there.
 *
 * `nestjs-backend.generator.ts` listed seven `src/common/**` files to render
 * and three of them had no template:
 *
 *   src/common/decorators/etag.decorator.ts
 *   src/common/guards/etag.guard.ts
 *   src/common/interceptors/logging.interceptor.ts
 *
 * Two were for an ETag feature nobody ever wrote — the only trace of it left
 * in the tree is `ETag` in the CORS `exposedHeaders` — and the third was
 * deliberately abandoned, because HTTP logging is a Fastify `onResponse` hook
 * and an interceptor would see no 401, no 403 and none of the better-auth
 * routes.
 *
 * None of that was visible, because the loop rendering them was wrapped in a
 * try/catch whose whole body was the comment "Template may not exist, skip".
 * A list allowed to lie will, and the cost is not the dead entries: it is
 * that a *live* one can go missing the same way. A Handlebars syntax error
 * raises through the same catch, so a template with a typo would silently
 * vanish from the generated application and the first symptom would be a
 * build failure somewhere else.
 *
 * This test sweeps every generator's source for template paths and asserts
 * each resolves on disk — so the sixteen arrays across the two generators are
 * covered, not just the one that rotted, and so is any ad-hoc
 * `renderTemplate` call that names a path inline.
