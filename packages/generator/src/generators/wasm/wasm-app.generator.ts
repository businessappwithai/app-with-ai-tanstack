/**
 * The browser stack's generator.
 *
 * It produces a `Map<path, contents>` rather than writing to disk, because the
 * two entry points that use it cannot agree on what disk means: the CLI writes
 * the map into a directory, and the hosted generator page posts it to a Service
 * Worker that serves it back as an application. Returning files instead of
 * writing them is what lets both do that without a second generator.
 *
 * Almost everything it emits is the same for every model — the runtime is
 * copied in verbatim from `templates/wasm`. The model-specific part is three
 * files: `app/model.json`, `app/schema.bus.sql`, and the title in `index.html`.
 * That ratio is the design, not an accident; see model-bundle.ts.

${options.description}

Generated by \`erdwithai-wasm\` from an EML model. It runs entirely in a browser
tab: PostgreSQL 18 compiled to WebAssembly, an application server on a Worker,
and a Service Worker answering the page's own \`/api\` requests. After the first
load nothing is fetched, and no data leaves the browser.

## Run it

\`\`\`bash
node serve.mjs         # any static host works; it must be http://, not file://
\`\`\`

Then open http://localhost:4000 and sign in as
**${options.adminEmail}** / **${options.adminPassword}**.

The first load starts Postgres and seeds the dictionary, which takes a few
seconds; the boot screen says what it is doing. The database is kept in
IndexedDB, so a reload reattaches to it. Add \`?ephemeral\` to the URL for a
clean in-memory run.

## Run the same backend under Node

\`\`\`bash
node host/node-host.mjs --port 4000
\`\`\`

The identical \`server/\` code on \`node:http\` instead of a Service Worker, against
the identical WebAssembly Postgres. Useful for scripting against the API, and it
is how the generator's own tests exercise it.

This application has no Bun in it and no build step: Node runs the host, the
browser runs the same code under its own Node-API runtime, and nothing is
compiled on the way in either direction. \`npm install\` is needed only when the
application was generated *without* \`--vendor-pglite\`, to fetch PGlite for the
Node host; in the browser it is fetched and cached by the browser itself.

## What is in here

| Path | |
|---|---|
| \`app/model.json\` | the compiled model: entities, dictionary, rules, processes, access rules |
| \`app/schema.*.sql\` | the schema — \`sys\` (fixed) and \`bus\` (yours) |
| \`server/\` | the backend: routing, CRUD, rules engine, guards, hooks |
| \`host/\` | the two runtimes that can start it — browser Worker, Node |
| \`ui/\` | the interface, drawn from the Application Dictionary |
| \`model/model.eml.mmd\` | the model this was generated from |

## This model

- **${parsed.entities.length}** entities: ${parsed.entities.map((entity) => entity.name).join(", ") || "—"}
- **${parsed.rules.length}** rules${parsed.rules.length ? `: ${parsed.rules.map((rule) => rule.name).join(", ")}` : ""}
- **${parsed.workflows.length}** state machines, **${parsed.sagas.length}** sagas
- **${parsed.hooks.length}** lifecycle hooks
- **${parsed.rbac.operations.length + parsed.rbac.transitions.length}** access restrictions

## What it is not

The roles here decide what the application shows and refuses, exactly as they
would on a server — but the database is a file in your own browser, so they are
not a secret from you. Point this model at the \`tanstackjs-nestjs\` stack when
the data needs to be somewhere other than the reader's machine.
