/**
 * The WASM overlay.
 *
 * `appwithai-wasm` does not have a stack of its own. It runs the same pipeline
 * `appwithai` runs — the same NestJS backend, the same TanStack Start front
 * end, the same migrations, guards, rules engine and dictionary — and then
 * changes the two things that stop that application running without a server:
 *
 *   the database   `pg` is replaced by a package of the same name backed by
 *                  PostgreSQL compiled to WebAssembly. Not one line of the
 *                  backend's own source changes, because none of it ever knew
 *                  what was on the far side of a `Pool`.
 *
 *   the runtime    every script that said `bun` says `node`, so the generated
 *                  application runs on the Node build that a browser's
 *                  Node-in-WASM runtime provides.
 *
 * One file is genuinely replaced rather than substituted: the audit ledger.
 * immudb is not a driver behind an interface, it is a second server, and there
 * is nowhere to put one. The replacement keeps the class, its methods and its
 * signatures, so `audit.service.ts` and `audit.controller.ts` are untouched.
 *
 * Everything here is deliberately additive or a whole-file write. Nothing
 * pattern-matches the generated source, because a rewrite that silently stops
 * matching produces an application that still dials TCP and says nothing.
