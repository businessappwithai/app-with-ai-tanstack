/**
 * `%%section` — the form's layout, read for the generator.
 *
 * The reading of the directive is `language/sections.ts`, the same module the
 * checker uses, so a model the checker accepts lays out exactly as it was
 * checked. This file only attaches the sections to their entities and turns
 * them into what both stacks' dictionaries store:
 *
 *   section             → sys_field_group (columns = 2, description = help)
 *   row, left / right   → sys_field.x_position 1 / 2, y_position = the row
 *   the right of a pair → sys_field.is_same_line = true
 *   a row of one        → sys_field.column_span = 2 (the full width)
 *   order on the form   → sys_field.seq_no, section by section, row by row
 *
 * An entity with no sections gets no layout, and is generated as it always was:
 * one flat list in declared order. A column no row places goes into a trailing
 * collapsed `Other` section (the checker reports it as EML172), so a sectioned
 * form never drops a field.
