/**
 * `/workflows` and `/workflow-definitions` — the processes the model declared.
 *
 * A state machine still has no endpoint that "runs" it, and inventing one would
 * be a second way to change a record's status that the guards, hooks and rules
 * on the ordinary update path know nothing about. **Moving a record is a PUT to
 * the record**, and that has not changed.
 *
 * What this module now also does is let an administrator edit the machine
 * itself — create a definition, change its transitions, retire it. That is a
 * different thing from running one: it changes which moves *exist*, not which
 * one a particular record is making, and it goes through the same table the
 * readers read (`sys_workflow_definitions`, via `lib/workflows.js`) so an edit
 * takes effect on the next request rather than at the next generation.
 *
 * Reads are open to any signed-in user; every write is administrator-only.
