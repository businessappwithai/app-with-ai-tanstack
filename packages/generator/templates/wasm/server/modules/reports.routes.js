/**
 * `/reports` — the questions the model declared with `%%report`.
 *
 * Each one is a title, a sentence saying who asks it and why, and the SQL that
 * answers it. The queries run against this application's own WebAssembly
 * PostgreSQL, which is the whole reason they can be here at all: the reporting
 * platform the orchestrator composes beside a deployed application needs a
 * server, a second database and a seeder, and a browser tab has none of those.
 * The same directive, read a second way.
 *
 * **The reports are a table now, and that is a reversal.** This comment used to
 * say they were not: that they came off `model.json`, that the model *was* the
 * definition, and that "nothing in this runtime edits a report, so nothing needs
 * a row to edit". The last clause was the load-bearing one and it stopped being
 * true the moment the administrator section was asked to offer create, update
 * and delete — at which point "no row to edit" is not a design, it is the reason
 * the feature cannot exist.
 *
 * So `sys_report` is seeded from `model.json` at first boot and read from after
 * that, which is what `sys_rule_definitions` already did for rules and what the
 * Application Dictionary does for screens. The NestJS stack has had the same
 * table since migration 018, so this also closes a gap between the two rather
 * than inventing something for one of them.
 *
 * The concern the old comment had — a copy that can disagree with the model — is
 * real and is the point rather than a cost: an administrator who edits a report
 * *means* to disagree with the model, the same way one who hides a field does.
 * Regenerating restores the model's version, because the seed skips a report
 * whose name is already there and a regenerated application starts on an empty
 * database.
