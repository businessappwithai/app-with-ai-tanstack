/**
 * `/reporting` — the Enterprise Reporting platform's surface, in a browser tab.
 *
 * The platform stores reports, charts and dashboards as definitions over saved
 * SQL queries, and holds a role table deciding which of a data source's tables
 * a reporting user's queries may read. These routes serve exactly those
 * definitions, from the pack the generator derived, against the same PGlite
 * database the application uses as its data source.
 *
 * What is the same as the deployed platform: the definitions, the roles, which
 * tables each role reads, and the refusal when a query names a table the role
 * does not.
 *
 * What is not: there is no SQL editor, nothing here writes a definition, and
 * the platform's NL→SQL pipeline, scheduled deliveries and knowledge graph need
 * servers this runtime does not have. A read-only mirror is worth more than a
 * set of buttons that answer "not in the browser build".
 *
 * ## Access
 *
 * A query declares the `bus_` tables it reads (`SavedQuerySpec.tables`, filled
 * in where the pack is derived). A role either reads every table or reads a
 * named set, and a query is visible when every table it names is in that set.
 * Checked twice on purpose: once when listing, so a report a role cannot run is
 * not offered, and again when running, because a list is a convenience and the
 * refusal is the boundary. The platform does the same thing with a SQL parser
 * and `ds_entity_permissions`; here the tables are already known, so there is
 * nothing to parse.
