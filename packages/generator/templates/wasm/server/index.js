/**
 * The application server.
 *
 * One factory, two hosts. `createServer` knows nothing about how a request
 * reached it or where its files live: the Node host hands it `node:http`
 * requests translated into `Request`, and the browser host hands it requests
 * the Service Worker intercepted. Everything host-shaped — the PGlite module,
 * reading an asset, the console — arrives as a parameter.
 *
 * That is what makes "the same backend" a claim rather than a hope. There is no
 * second implementation of the routes for the browser to drift from; the Node
 * host exists so that the code running in a tab can also be started, exercised
 * and tested from a terminal.
