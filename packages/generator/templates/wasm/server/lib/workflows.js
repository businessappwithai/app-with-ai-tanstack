/**
 * Where a workflow is read from — the table, not the model.
 *
 * `sys_workflow_definitions` is seeded at first boot from `model.workflows`,
 * storing each workflow object whole in the `definition` column. Until now it
 * was written there and read by three listing endpoints and nothing else: every
 * *behavioural* use of a workflow — which transitions a record is offered, and
 * whether a status change is recorded as modelled — read `model.workflows`
 * instead, the copy compiled into the bundle.
 *
 * That split is fine while nothing can change either. It stops being fine the
 * moment the admin screen can edit a workflow, because the edit lands in the
 * table and the application keeps behaving from the model: a definition that is
 * "seeded, visible in the admin screen, drawn by the viewer, and inert" — the
 * failure this codebase has already documented once, in the dance-studio
 * model's sixteen `%%action` lines.
 *
 * So the table is the source of truth, the way `sys_rule_definitions` already
 * is for rules (`bus.routes.js` enforces from that table, not from
 * `model.rules`) and the way the Application Dictionary is for screens. The
 * model seeds it; after that, what the database says is what the application
 * does.
 *
 * **The fallback to the model is deliberate and narrow.** An application
 * generated before this table was seeded, or one whose seed was interrupted,
 * would otherwise lose its state machines entirely rather than degrade — and
 * losing them silently disables the transition UI on every record. Falling back
 * keeps such an application behaving exactly as it did before.

/**
 * Every workflow for one entity, newest definition wins on a name collision.
