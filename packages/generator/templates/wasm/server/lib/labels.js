/**
 * What a record is called, when something other than the record is showing it.
 *
 * A reference column stores a uuid. Every screen that displays one has to turn
 * it back into something a person recognises — the form's lookup dropdown, and
 * the grid, which used to print the uuid itself. Both ask this module, so a
 * record cannot be "Northwind Systems" in the dropdown and
 * `39febc1c-8585-…` in the table it was chosen from.
 *
 * The choice is made from the Application Dictionary rather than from a list of
 * column names the generator hopes exist: the model decides what its tables
 * look like, so the dictionary is the only thing that knows.

/**
 * Pick the label for a table, from its `sys_column` rows.
 *
 * The dictionary already answers this: `is_identifier` marks the columns that
 * say what a record *is*, and a record's display value is those columns in
 * `seq_no` order. `first_name` and `last_name` are both identifiers on a person
 * table, which is why this concatenates rather than picking one — and it is the
 * same rule the generated NestJS backend follows, so a record is called the
 * same thing in both stacks.
 *
 * The key is never an identifier (see `identifierColumnNames`), so nothing here
 * has to filter it out. A table with no identifier at all falls back to the key,
 * because a lookup listing ids still beats a text box asking for one.
 *
 * Returns the key column, a readable name for the label, and the SQL expression
 * that produces it.
