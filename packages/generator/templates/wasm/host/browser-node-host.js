/**
 * The browser host — a Node-shaped runtime for the backend, inside a Worker.
 *
 * This is the counterpart of `node-host.mjs`. It boots the same
 * `server/index.js` against the same PGlite build, on a thread of its own, and
 * answers requests the Service Worker forwards to it. Between the two files
 * there is no second implementation of the application: the backend is one
 * codebase that two hosts can start.
 *
 * A Worker is not Node, so the parts of Node the backend and PGlite reach for
 * are provided here. The list is deliberately short and deliberately honest —
 * `process` (env, argv, versions, platform, cwd, nextTick, hrtime), `Buffer`
 * (the byte-array surface, not the streams one), and a `node:path`/`node:util`
 * subset. Anything outside it throws by name instead of returning undefined,
 * because a missing shim that fails loudly costs an hour and one that returns
 * undefined costs a day.
 *
 * Why a Worker at all: Postgres in WebAssembly does real work, and on the main
 * thread a seed of a few thousand rows freezes the tab it is seeding. The
 * database and the server share this thread; the UI keeps its own.
