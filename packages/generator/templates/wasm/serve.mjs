/**
 * The application's own static server.
 *
 * A generated application has no dependencies and needs exactly one thing from
 * its host: to be reachable over http, because a Service Worker cannot be
 * registered from a `file://` URL. Telling the reader to `npx serve` makes that
 * one requirement into a network round trip and a package install, so the
 * fifty lines are here instead.
 *
 *   node serve.mjs            # http://localhost:4000
 *   node serve.mjs --port 8080
 *
 * This serves files. The application server is `host/node-host.mjs`, or the
 * browser itself.
