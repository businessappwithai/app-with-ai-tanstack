 * intercepts, and a `Set-Cookie` on a response it synthesises is not stored — so
 * an application hosted this way signs in successfully, gets a session, and then
 * cannot prove it has one. The symptom is a login that works and a first render
 * that bounces straight back to the login screen.
 *
 * The server accepts either, so this same UI works unchanged against the Node
 * host, where cookies are ordinary cookies.
 *
 * The token lives in `sessionStorage`: a reload keeps you signed in, a new tab
 * does not inherit the session, and closing the tab ends it.
