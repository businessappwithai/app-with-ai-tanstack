/**
 * The shell: masthead, action bar, breadcrumb, and which screen is on show.
 *
 * The arrangement is the React application's, not an invention — a masthead
 * carrying the application's name, a global search and the signed-in user; an
 * action bar of Search / New / Save; a breadcrumb under it; the screen below.
 * Two applications generated from one model should not look like two products,
 * so where this file had a choice it copied rather than improved.
 *
 * Routing is hash-based. A history-API router would need the Service Worker to
 * return `index.html` for every unknown path, which it happily would — but this
 * application is also embedded in an iframe on the page that generated it, and
 * a pushState there rewrites the *host* page's URL. A hash cannot.
