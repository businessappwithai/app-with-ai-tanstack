/**
 * The test vocabulary these suites are written in.
 *
 * They used to import it from `bun:test`, which meant the application could not
 * be tested without Bun — awkward for a stack whose whole point is running under
 * Node with PostgreSQL compiled to WebAssembly, and the last thing keeping Bun
 * in a generated wasm application at all.
 *
 * `node:test` supplies the runner. What it does not supply is `expect`, so the
 * choice was to rewrite four hundred assertions into `assert.strictEqual` or to
 * write the twenty lines below. The assertions are the readable part of a test
 * suite; a mechanical rewrite of all of them would have been a large diff that
 * made every one of them worse.
 *
 * So this is `expect` with exactly the matchers these suites use — and it fails
 * loudly on any matcher it does not have, rather than quietly passing. Both
 * runners understand `node:test`, so `bun test` still works for anyone on the
 * Bun stack and `node --test` works for everyone else.
