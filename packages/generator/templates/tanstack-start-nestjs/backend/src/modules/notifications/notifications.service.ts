 * it could not — and both are recorded in `audit_log` against the user who
 * made them. This service reads those rows back for one user and turns them
 * into sentences.
 *
 * It reads the trail and nothing else. There is no notification table to fall
 * out of step with what happened, no second copy of a failure message, and
 * nothing to reconcile: if the trail does not say it, the user is not told it.
 * The only thing stored alongside is a read mark per (user, row).
