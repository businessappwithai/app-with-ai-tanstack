/**
 * One record's history, and the notes people have left on it.
 *
 * Both surfaces are *per record* and both are scoped to the entity the record
 * belongs to, which is what separates them from `AuditController`. That
 * controller serves the whole log — every table, every sign-in attempt, the
 * before and after of every changed field — and is administrator-only for
 * exactly that reason. Narrowed to one record of one table, the same data is
 * simply what happened to something the caller is already looking at, so the
 * gate is the entity's own `read` rather than an admin role. A trail only
 * administrators can see is a trail nobody consults.
 *
 * Notes are kept in `sys_note` rather than in the audit log. The trail records
 * what the system observed and must not be editable; a note is somebody's
 * sentence about the same record. One table for both would make the history
 * writable, which is the one thing an audit trail may not be.
