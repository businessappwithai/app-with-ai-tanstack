/**
 * Application Dictionary — TanStack DB collections synced by ElectricSQL.
 *
 * Every dictionary read in this app goes through one of the collections below.
 * A collection is populated once, by an Electric shape stream through the
 * backend's role-scoped proxy, and then lives in memory: reads are synchronous
 * lookups against local state, and `useLiveQuery` recomputes only the rows a
 * change actually touched. There is no per-screen fetch and no request waterfall
 * — opening a window costs nothing over the network.
 *
 * Scoping is the server's decision. The proxy derives the caller's roles from
 * the session and filters each shape before it streams, so what arrives here is
 * already only the part of the dictionary this user may see. The client never
 * says who it is.
 *
 * Collections are created lazily, after a session exists, because the shape
 * request must carry the session cookie to be scoped at all. `resetSysCollections()`
 * drops them on logout so the next user does not read the previous user's rows.
 *
