/**
 * The generated application's side of the rules & workflows screen.
 *
 * `LogicWorkbench` (vendored from `@appwithai/editors`, the same source the modelling
 * tool's Logic step renders) owns everything an author does on the screen. It owns no I/O:
 * it is handed the rules and workflows as editable objects and a `save` that is told the
 * whole list. This file is that I/O for a running application — rules in `sys_rule_definitions`
 * through `/api/rules`, processes, hook workflows and status machines in
 * `sys_workflow_definitions` through `/api/workflow-definitions`.
 *
 * Saving diffs against what was loaded, so an edit writes the rows that changed and nothing
 * else. What the model declares (`RULE_MODEL`) decides what a rule may name.
 *
 * A status flow is editable whether the model declared it or it was drawn here: the API runs
 * the stored one (`kind = 'state'`) in place of the model's, so an edit changes how records
 * move. A declared flow nobody has changed has no row; editing it writes one, and deleting
 * that row puts the model's flow back. The model's hook and saga workflows stay read-only.
