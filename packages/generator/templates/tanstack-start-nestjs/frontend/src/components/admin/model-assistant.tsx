/**
 * The administrator's model assistant, and everything it drags in with it.
 *
 * This module exists to be a chunk boundary. `@copilotkit/react-core` depends
 * on `streamdown`, which depends on `mermaid` and on `shiki` with its full
 * grammar set — a measured 2.36MB of JavaScript for mermaid alone, and enough
 * shiki grammars (emacs-lisp, wolfram, objective-cpp, asciidoc, …) to take the
 * built client output past 20MB. Imported from the /admin layout directly,
 * every one of those bytes was on the critical path of every administrator
 * screen, whether or not anyone opened the assistant. It made /admin the
 * heaviest page in the application by a factor of three while it rendered
 * nothing anyone could see.
 *
 * Nothing here is imported statically anywhere. `src/routes/admin.tsx` reaches
 * it through `React.lazy`, when the administrator asks for the assistant.
