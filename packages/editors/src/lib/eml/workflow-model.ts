/**
 * A stored workflow, read into the shape the workflow editors edit — and written back.
 *
 * A workflow is stored as a Mermaid diagram plus the few fields that ride on the
 * `%%workflow` directive. The modelling tool keeps that in the project's EML document; a
 * generated application keeps the same text in its workflow definitions. Either host reads
 * and writes it through these two functions, so a lifecycle, a status machine or a process
 * opens the same way in both and saves the same bytes.
