/**
 * Monaco, served by this application.
 *
 * The GoRules editor draws its code boxes — the Record schema, a function
 * node's source, the Simulator's request — with Monaco, and Monaco's loader
 * fetches itself from a public CDN unless an instance is already on `window`.
 * That put a third-party host between a person and their own rules: the boxes
 * sat on a spinner behind a firewall or offline. Importing it here makes Vite
 * bundle it and its workers beside the application, and handing the loader the
 * instance it asks for first means it never reaches for the network.
 *
 * The workers are imported from the one-line entries in `monaco-workers/`, not
 * as `monaco-editor/editor/editor.worker?worker`. A query on a package subpath
 * reaches monaco's `exports` map, whose `"./*": "./esm/vs/*.js"` can swallow it:
 * on macOS the id came back as `editor.worker.js?worker.js`, Vite read
 * `worker.js` as no worker query at all, served the file as a plain module, and
 * the page failed with `does not provide an export named 'default'`. A relative
 * path never goes through `exports`, and each entry imports the worker with no
 * query, which resolves the same everywhere.
 *
 * Browser only. Import it from the same lazy chunk as the editor, never from a
 * module the server renders.
