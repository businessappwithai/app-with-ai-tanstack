/**
 * Regression: ISSUE-007 — every rule table opened as an empty one.
 * Found by /qa on 2026-09-01.
 * Report: .gstack/qa-reports/qa-report-dance-studio-qa-2026-09-01.md
 *
 * The generated /admin/automations screen defined its own private
 * `asDecisionTable` next to the complete one already sitting in
 * `lib/automation/rule-content.ts`. The private copy accepted only a decision
 * table passed as a live object — not the JSON string the rules endpoint
 * actually returns, and not the JDM node graph that `%%action` compiles to. So
 * every rule fell through to `emptyDecisionTable()`, and the screen listed all
 * eighteen of them as "1 inputs · 1 rows" while `packOpeningBalance` had 2 rows,
 * `bookingGate` 3 and `bus_class_session_validation` 7.
 *
 * The count was the visible half. The editor beside it opened the same empty
 * table, so saving would have replaced a real rule with a blank one.
 *
 * The two ends belong to different packages and are edited apart, so the
 * property worth holding is the round trip: what the generator compiles from
 * `%%action`, the reader that opens it reports at full size.
