/**
 * Production server for the generator app.
 *
 * `vite build` emits two halves: a request handler in `dist/server`, and the
 * client bundle in `dist/client`. The handler renders and answers API routes but
 * knows nothing about the second half — nothing in it serves a `.js` or a font.
 * In development Vite does that job; in production this does.
 *
 * Static files are tried first and the handler gets everything else, because a
 * built asset path is always a real file and an app route never is. Assets carry
 * a content hash in their name, so they are safe to cache indefinitely; anything
 * else (`favicon.ico`, `robots.txt`) is not, and is not told to be.
 *
 * Run with `bun run start` after `bun run build`.

/**
 * Load the repository's `.env`, without overriding what is already set.
 *
 * `bun run start` runs with cwd `packages/web`, and Bun's automatic `.env`
 * loading is per-process at cwd: it looks for `packages/web/.env`, which does
 * not exist, and never sees the root file the README tells you to create. So a
 * local `bun run build && bun run start` came up with no `DATABASE_URL` and
 * answered every database request with "no PostgreSQL user name specified in
 * startup packet" — the same trap `vite.config.ts` already documents and solves
 * with `loadEnv` for the dev server.
 *
 * Real environment variables win. In a deployment there is no `.env` file and
 * the orchestrator supplies everything, so this is a no-op there; where both
 * exist, the process environment is the one that was chosen deliberately.
