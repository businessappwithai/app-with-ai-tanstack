/**
 * A model rule, read into the shape the rule editor edits — and written back.
 *
 * Both the Logic step and the Enhance page edit the same `%%rule` sections, and
 * they used to read them differently. Enhance recognised a rule written as
 * `%%action` directives and opened it as the decision table it compiles to;
 * Logic did not, so every such rule opened there as a read-only flowchart whose
 * only offer was "Start an empty table instead" — which discarded the actions.
 * One reader, used by both, is what keeps the two screens describing one model.
