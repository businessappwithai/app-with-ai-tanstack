/**
 * A rule written as `%%action` directives, opened on the Logic step.
 *
 * The Logic step read rules without asking how they were stored, so every rule
 * written as `%%action` lines — six of the education model's ten — opened as a
 * read-only flowchart whose only offer was "Start an empty table instead",
 * which discarded the actions. The Enhance page already knew better; both now
 * go through `toEditableRule`, and this holds the round trip they share.
