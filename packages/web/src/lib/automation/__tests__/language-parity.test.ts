/**
 * The language definition must describe the builder that ships.
 *
 * `language/erdwithai-language.json` is declared the single source of truth for
 * EML, but nothing enforced that — the automation builder was written with its
 * own trigger, operator and step vocabulary and the definition was never
 * updated, so the canonical description of the language omitted the dialect
 * every stored automation is written in. That drift is invisible: both sides
 * work perfectly on their own, and only a reader trusting the definition to
 * write an automation would discover it.
 *
 * These tests pin the two together in the direction that matters. `model.ts` is
 * the implementation and therefore wins ties; the definition is checked for
 * being complete and accurate about it, not the other way round.
