 * "When an Order is created, only if Order.total is greater than 1000, then

 *
 * That sentence is the whole model. A trigger, a flat list of conditions that
 * must all pass, and an ordered list of steps. There is deliberately no graph
 * here: the executor runs steps in order and stops at the first failure, so a
 * list is the honest representation and the one the builder can draw as a
 * ladder without inventing layout the author never asked for.
 *
 * Storage is unchanged. `serializeAutomation` writes the same mermaid
 * flowchart with `%%` directives the parser already reads, so automations
 * saved before this builder existed still open, and anything saved here still
 * runs through the existing executor.
