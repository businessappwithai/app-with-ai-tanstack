/**
 * One line per request, without writing one in every route.
 *
 * TanStack Start's server handlers are plain `Request → Response` functions, so
 * there is no middleware chain to hang a logger on. `withRequestLogging` wraps a
 * handler instead: same signature in, same signature out, so a route adopts it
 * by wrapping the function it already had.
 *
 *     GET: withRequestLogging("/api/projects/$id", async ({ request, params }) => …)
 *
 * The route pattern is passed rather than read off the URL on purpose. Logging
 * the concrete path puts the id in the message, which means a thousand distinct
 * "messages" for one endpoint and no way to aggregate by route — the id belongs
 * in a field, and it is already in `path`.
 *
 * What a wrapped handler guarantees, which the routes did not:
 *
 *   - Every response is reported, at a level that matches its status: 5xx is an
 *     error, 4xx a warning, everything else info.
 *   - A handler that *throws* becomes a logged 500 rather than an unhandled
 *     rejection, so the caller gets JSON instead of a hung socket.
 *   - Every request gets an id, echoed back as `x-request-id`, so a line in a
 *     log aggregator and a failure a user is describing can be joined up.
