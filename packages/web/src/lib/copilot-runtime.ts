 * wrong with that. The project does not call the Anthropic API any more — the
 * key is dead config, so the assistant answered every message with an auth
 * error — and a hard-coded model string is exactly what `packages/ai/src/config.ts`

 *
 * The adapter now points at the same local OpenAI-compatible endpoint every
 * agent uses, resolved from that one config module.
