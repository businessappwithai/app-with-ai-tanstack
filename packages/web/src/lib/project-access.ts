/**
 * Who may read or edit a project.
 *
 * A project is owned by the user who created it and shared with the members
 * listed in `project_members`. That rule has to hold for every route that
 * touches a project, not just the ones that happen to remember it: a model is
 * a company's data design, and reading someone else's by guessing an id is the
 * same disclosure whether it arrives as JSON, as an `.mmd` download, or as the
 * parsed sections an editor loads.
 *
 * The check lives here rather than in each route so there is one implementation
 * to keep correct — a copy in one file and not another is exactly how the EML
 * routes ended up open while `/api/projects/$id` was closed.
