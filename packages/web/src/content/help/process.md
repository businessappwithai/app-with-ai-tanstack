# Processes

A process is a **sequence of steps the application carries out in order**. For
example: check the invoice is overdue, look up the late-fee rule, add the fee,
update the invoice, tell the finance system. It reads like a ladder, from
*When this happens* at the top to the last step at the bottom.

Use a process when one decision leads to **several changes**, possibly to
**other records**, possibly to **another system**. A single refusal or a single
field stamp is a business rule. A status move is a status machine.

## Building one

1. Click **+ Process**. A process called *Untitled process* opens.
2. Click the title and type a name, e.g. `Overdue Invoice Chase`.
3. On the right, choose the **Record type** the process runs on and **What
   starts it** (see below).
4. Click **＋ Add a condition or an action** and pick a step type. The small
   **＋** between two cards inserts a step at that point.
5. Click any card to edit it in the inspector on the right. **✕** on a card
   removes it.

## What starts it

| Choice | When the process runs |
| ------ | --------------------- |
| **A business rule decides** | Only when a rule row with the action `trigger-workflow` names this process in **Workflow Name**. The rule decides *whether*; the process says *what then*. |
| **The record's own lifecycle** | Every time a record of this type is written. Pick the operation (**CREATE**, **UPDATE**, …) that starts it. |

## The step types

Each step can **save its answer** under a name (the *Save the answer as* box),
and every later step can use that answer by writing `{{name}}`, or
`{{name.field}}` for one field of it. Fields of the record the process runs on
are available the same way, e.g. `{{feeinvoice.balance_due}}`. Boxes that
accept a reference suggest the values available at that point in the ladder.

### ◇ A check — *only continue if*

The steps below it run only when the check holds.

| Field | Example |
| ----- | ------- |
| **Field to look at** | `feeinvoice.balance_due` |
| **Test** | *is*, *is not*, *is greater than*, *is greater than or equal to*, *is less than*, *is less than or equal to*, *contains*, *starts with*, *is empty*, *is not empty*, *changed* |
| **Value** | `0`. Hidden for *is empty*, *is not empty* and *changed*, which compare against nothing. |

### ↻ A repeat — *keep repeating while*

Runs the steps inside it again and again **while** its check holds. The check
is re-read before every pass, so a step inside the repeat must change something
that eventually makes it false.

| Field | Meaning |
| ----- | ------- |
| **Field to look at** / **Keep going while** / **Value** | The check, as above. |
| **Give up after (required)** | A safety limit on the number of passes, e.g. `10`. Reaching it means the repeat never ended on its own, so the run is marked **failed** rather than finishing quietly. Every repeat must state one. |

A new repeat starts with one empty step inside it. Use **＋ Add a step inside
this repeat** for more. Repeats do not nest.

### ▤ Look up a rule table

Asks one of this model's **business rules** for an answer.

| Field | Meaning |
| ----- | ------- |
| **Rule table** | Any rule on this screen, by its identifier, e.g. `lateFeeGuard`. **Open table →** jumps to it. |
| **Save the answer as** | Defaults to `decision`. Later steps read `{{decision.action}}`, `{{decision.message}}`, and so on, one per outcome column. |

### ✚ Create a record

| Field | Meaning |
| ----- | ------- |
| **Record type** | What to insert, e.g. `DisciplineIncident`. |
| **Columns to set** | One `column: value` per line. A value is text, a number, `true`/`false`, or a reference such as `{{student_id}}`. |
| **Save the answer as** | Defaults to `createdId`: the new row's id, for a later step to update or delete it. |

```
status: reported
student_id: {{student_id}}
severity: 2
```

The lines are saved as the JSON map the generated application reads. A
map already written as JSON in the model opens as lines.

### ✎ Update a field

| Field | Meaning |
| ----- | ------- |
| **Record type** | The record to change, usually the one the process runs on. |
| **Field to write** | Picked from that record type's columns. |
| **New value** | A fixed value (`overdue`) or a reference (`{{newBalance}}`). |

### ✕ Delete a record

| Field | Meaning |
| ----- | ------- |
| **Record type** | What to delete. |
| **Which record** | Usually a reference from an earlier step, e.g. `{{incidentId}}`. |

Deletes are **soft** by default: the row is stamped as deleted, so the audit
trail can still reach it.

### ƒ Work out a value

| Field | Meaning |
| ----- | ------- |
| **Operation** | `set`, `copy`, `add`, `subtract`, `multiply`, `divide` |
| **Value to work from** / **And this value** | The two operands, e.g. `{{feeinvoice.balance_due}}` and `25` |
| **Save the answer as** | Defaults to `value`, e.g. rename it `newBalance` and write it back with *Update a field*. |

### ↗ Call a web service

| Field | Meaning |
| ----- | ------- |
| **Method** | `POST`, `PUT`, `PATCH`, `GET` or `DELETE` |
| **URL** | The endpoint, e.g. `https://example.com/hooks/overdue` |
| **Body** | JSON. References like `{{feeinvoice.id}}` are filled in before sending. You may lay it out over several lines; it is saved on one. |
| **Save the answer as** | Defaults to `response`, the reply, for later steps. |

## The orange notices

The line under the title counts the problems, and each card repeats its own:
*"Step 2 is missing a rule table to look up"*, *"Add at least one thing for
this to do"*. A process with problems still saves, so you can finish it later,
but it does not do what it says until they are fixed.

## Worked example: *Overdue Invoice Chase*

1. **+ Process**, name it, Record type **FeeInvoice**, starts from **The
   record's own lifecycle** on **UPDATE**.
2. **A check**: `feeinvoice.balance_due` *is greater than* `0`.
3. **Look up a rule table**: `lateFeeGuard`, saved as `decision`.
4. **Work out a value**: *add* `{{feeinvoice.balance_due}}` and `25`, saved as
   `newBalance`.
5. **Update a field**: FeeInvoice · `balance_due` · `{{newBalance}}`.
6. **Call a web service**: `POST` to your finance system with
   `{"invoice":"{{feeinvoice.id}}"}`.
7. **Save**.
