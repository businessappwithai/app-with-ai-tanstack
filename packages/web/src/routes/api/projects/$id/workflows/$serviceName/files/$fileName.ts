/**
 * Save one generated hook source back to disk.
 *
 * The enhance screen lists the hook files the generator wrote for an entity,
 * lets somebody edit one, and posts it here. This used to answer
 * `{"success": true, "message": "File saved successfully"}` over a `TODO`, so
 * the editor reported a save every time and the file on disk never changed —
 * the worst shape a bug can take, because the person editing has no reason to
 * look again.
 *
 * The file is written under exactly the directory the companion listing reads
 * from, and the name has to be one that already exists there. That is the whole
 * authorization story for the path: a caller cannot create a file, cannot reach
 * a directory the listing would not show them, and cannot escape the tree with
 * a crafted name — `..`, separators and anything that is not a `.ts` file are
 * refused before the path is built.
