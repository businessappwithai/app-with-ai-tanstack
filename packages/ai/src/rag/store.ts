/**
 * The vector store for model context.

 * One pgvector index holds every project's chunks plus the EML specification,
 * separated by a `projectId` on the metadata rather than by an index each.
 * A per-project index would mean creating and dropping indexes as projects come
 * and go, and would make the specification — which every project needs — either
 * duplicated per project or unreachable from a filtered query.
 *
 * The specification is stored under a reserved project id so a single query can
 * ask for "this project's model and the language spec" without a second round
 * trip.
