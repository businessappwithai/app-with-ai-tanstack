/**
 * Put a copy of PGlite beside the guide, so `html/run-in-browser.html` runs
 * with the network off.
 *
 * Not checked in: it is ~17MB of WebAssembly, most of it one `.wasm` and one
 * `.data`, and a documentation folder is the wrong place to keep that in git.
 * The page falls back to a CDN when this has not been run, and says which one
 * it used in its log — so the difference is visible rather than mysterious.
