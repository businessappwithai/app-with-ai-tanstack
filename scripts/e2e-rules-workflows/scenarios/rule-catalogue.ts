/**
 * Forty-two business rules, each built in the Logic step's decision table
 * through its own controls, tried with sample records in "Try it", saved and
 * reopened. Between them they use every operator the table offers — Text,
 * Number, Boolean and Date — every answer (validation-error, transform, allow),
 * one to three input columns, one to three rows, and a spread of priorities.
 *
 * An input is written `Tab:operator[:value]`, exactly as the operator palette
 * words it ("Number:greater than:60", "Text:is one of:a,b", "Number:between:7,13").
 * Outputs beginning "@" are picked from the column's list; others are typed.
