/**
 * Bundle the EML checker and fixer as two standalone files for the web.
 *
 * `html/checker.js` and `html/fixer.js` are what an author — or a model writing
 * a model — validates a `.eml.mmd` against without a checkout, a Bun install or
 * a terminal. They sit at the site root rather than under `assets/` because
 * their URL is the interface: `llmtext/llms-full.txt` tells a language model to
 * run its output past appwithai.org/checker.js, and a path that reads like an
 * implementation detail invites being moved.
 *
 * Two files, not one, because they are two tools and a caller usually wants only
 * the first. The checker duplicated inside `fixer.js` is the price of `fixer.js`
 * being able to re-check what it repaired without a second fetch, which is the
 * loop that makes the repair trustworthy.
 *
 * Nothing here re-implements a rule. Both entry points inject the inlined
 * language definition and re-export the pure functions from `language/checker.ts`
 * and `language/fixer.ts` — the same engines the CLIs run.
 *
 *   bun run build:language-tools
 *   bun run build:language-tools --check    # fail if the checked-in copies are stale
