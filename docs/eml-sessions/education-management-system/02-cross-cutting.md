# Phase 5 — the cross-cutting pass

What no single entity owns, once every entity is in. §10.5.

## Multi-entity sagas

Five, each `kind: saga trigger: rule` so the rule's condition decides rather than
every write firing it.

| Saga | Triggered by | Steps | What compensates a failure |
|---|---|---|---|
| `AdmissionToEnrolment` | `enrolOnAcceptance` — `status == "accepted"` on `AdmissionApplication` | create `Student` → stamp `student_id` back on the application → create the term's `FeeInvoice` in `draft` | The invoice is created in `draft`, so a half-run leaves nothing billable. An application with `status = accepted` and a blank `student_id` is the visible failure, and `admissions-conversion-by-band` counts it as accepted, so the discrepancy surfaces. |
| `InvoiceSettlement` | `settleInvoice` — `amount >= balance_before` on `Payment` | move the invoice to `paid` | The payment stands and the invoice does not move; `finance-unapplied-payments` is the report that finds exactly that. |
| `PartPaymentPosting` | `postPartPayment` — `amount < balance_before` | move the invoice to `part_paid` | Same, and the same report. |
| `SectionCancellation` | `withdrawEnrolmentsOnCancellation` — `status == "cancelled"` on `ClassSection` | withdraw every enrolment on the section | An enrolment left `enrolled` on a cancelled section still shows in `registrar-section-fill`, and the student keeps a timetable slot that does not exist. |
| `SuspensionEscalation` | `suspendOnSuspension` — `sanction == "suspension"` on `DisciplineIncident` | suspend the student | A suspension recorded with the student still `enrolled` is visible in `counsellor-current-suspensions`, which lists suspended students and their incident and shows the mismatch as a missing row. |

**Every state a saga writes is a state its machine draws, from where the record
actually stands** — the §10.6 check, run mechanically over the document:

```
OK   saga writes FeeInvoice  -> paid        (issued → paid, part_paid → paid, overdue → paid)
OK   saga writes FeeInvoice  -> part_paid   (issued → part_paid, part_paid → part_paid, overdue → part_paid)
OK   saga writes Enrollment  -> withdrawn   (pending → withdrawn, enrolled → withdrawn)
OK   saga writes Student     -> suspended   (enrolled → suspended, on_leave → suspended)
```

Two edges exist only because this check asked for them, and both would have been
403s in a running application:

- `part_paid --> part_paid : record_further_part_payment` — a **second** partial
  payment. This is the transition §10.6 names as the one that is always
  forgotten, and the research called it out in §4 before any diagram was drawn.
- `on_leave --> suspended : suspend` — a serious incident concerning a student
  who is on leave. Without it `SuspensionEscalation` would fire, be refused, and
  leave the incident recording a sanction that never took effect.

A payment against a **draft** invoice is deliberately left with no edge:
`draft → paid` does not exist, so the guard refuses it. That is the correct
behaviour — an unissued invoice has not been sent to anybody — and it is written
down here so that the 403 is read as the model working rather than as a bug.

## What is *not* a rule, and why

Three checks that read like rules and are not, because a `when:` is evaluated
against the record being written and nothing else (§10.4). Each was written the
wrong way first and would have been seeded, drawn by the viewers, and inert:

| Check | Route taken |
|---|---|
| A section is full | **Route 2 — the whole check moved into the handler.** `checkSectionCapacity` on `beforeCreate` of `Enrollment` resolves the section and refuses. No action was left behind. |
| A payment exceeds what is owed | **Route 1 — made a column.** `resolveInvoiceBalance` stamps `Payment.balance_before`, which earns its place on a receipt independently, and `refuseOverpayment` reads it as an ordinary column. |
| A score exceeds the paper's maximum | **Route 1 — made a column.** `copyAssessmentMaximum` stamps `AssessmentResult.max_score`, which the invoice-line precedent already justifies: a paper rescaled next year must not rewrite marks already awarded. |

Three more are two-row facts with no honest column to hang them on, so they are
**reports rather than refusals**, and are named as such rather than promised:
a second primary contact per student, a timetable clash, and assessment weights
that do not total 100.

Two moves are the clock's and not a rule's: `mark_overdue` on an invoice, and an
admission offer expiring. Both are scheduled work; the model draws the edges and
the reports (`finance-overdue-invoices`, `admissions-offers-unanswered`) are what
a person acts from.

## The `%%rbac` matrix as a whole

Eight roles, 68 directives, and every entity carries a `read` line. Read counts —
the number of entities a role can see, which is the number of screens it signs in
to — are what the viewers' **Access** tab reports and what decides whether a role
is worth seeding at all:

| Role | Entities it can read | What it does |
|---|---|---|
| `principal` | 19 of 19 | Everything, including conduct. |
| `registrar` | 17 | Everything academic and financial except conduct, payments and applications' decisions. |
| `finance_officer` | 11 | Money, and the people it is owed by. |
| `counsellor` | 10 | Pastoral: students, guardians, attendance, conduct. |
| `teacher` | 12 | Their teaching surface: students, groups, sessions, registers, assessments. |
| `head_of_department` | 12 | The teaching surface plus the department's staff and courses. |
| `admissions_officer` | 8 | Applications, applicants, guardians, terms, courses, staff. |
| `guardian` | 11 | Their child's timetable, attendance, results and fees. |

No role reads 0 of 19, which is the failure §10.5 tells you to look for. Two
deliberate narrownesses are recorded rather than left to be discovered:

1. **`DisciplineIncident` is readable by `counsellor` and `principal` only.** A
   teacher therefore cannot record one — they report it to the pastoral team,
   who record it with the teacher named in `reported_by_id`. The alternative
   would have put every conduct record in front of every teacher, which research
   §7 rules out.
2. **`guardian` is a role, not a row filter.** `%%rbac` restricts by role and
   cannot scope a guardian to their own child; the four guardian reports are
   written for a portal that applies that filter. Stated in the research (§7) and
   again here, because a model that silently promised row-level scoping would be
   a safeguarding failure rather than a missing feature.

## Indexes

Fourteen, and each one is a column pair a declared flow actually filters by —
not a guess:

`Student(status, year_group)` · `Enrollment(class_section_id, status)` ·
`Enrollment(student_id, status)` · `ClassSession(starts_at, status)` ·
`ClassSection(academic_term_id, status)` · `AttendanceRecord(class_session_id, status)` ·
`AttendanceRecord(student_id, status)` · `AssessmentResult(assessment_id, status)` ·
`FeeInvoice(status, due_on)` · `FeeInvoice(student_id, academic_term_id)` ·
`Payment(fee_invoice_id, received_at)` · `AdmissionApplication(status, submitted_on)` ·
`DisciplineIncident(status, occurred_at)` · `StudentGuardian(student_id, contact_order)`

Every one of them appears in the `WHERE` or `GROUP BY` of at least one report
above, which is the test §10.5 sets.

## The coverage sweep

Run as a checklist, not a review:

- [x] every entity has `%%entity <Name> help:` — 19 of 19;
- [x] **every column** has `%%field <E>.<col> help:` — 159 of 159 non-key columns,
      verified by the dossier generator, which prints `**no help text**` where one
      is missing and printed none;
- [x] every child has a parent and a foreign key back to it — 4 children, no
      `EML148`;
- [x] every state in every `stateDiagram-v2` is backed by a declared `%%enum` —
      11 machines, no `EML426`/`EML428`;
- [x] every cross-entity effect from every dossier landed somewhere real — 5
      sagas, 19 hooks, and the three that deliberately did not are listed above;
- [x] every rule that must act is an `%%action`, not a node-graph — 10 rule
      sections, 9 of them decision tables; `admissionAssessment` is the one node
      graph and its dossier says in terms that it decides only;
- [x] nothing relies on a directive for behaviour its `status` does not support —
      `%%report` is validated here and compiled by the reporting pack, which is
      where the reports are used.

## The reporting pass

40 `%%report` directives across the eight roles, each answering one of §10.5.1's
four questions in that role's own terms:

| Role | Reports | The "that's wrong, fix it today" one |
|---|---|---|
| `principal` | 6 | `principal-teaching-cover-gap` — groups whose teacher has left |
| `registrar` | 6 | `registrar-timetable-clashes` — a child booked into two rooms at once |
| `teacher` | 5 | `teacher-registers-not-taken` — a hole in the statutory return |
| `head_of_department` | 4 | `hod-weights-not-adding-up` — a grade that means nothing |
| `admissions_officer` | 4 | `admissions-offers-unanswered` — a place held for a family who has gone elsewhere |
| `finance_officer` | 7 | `finance-unapplied-payments` — money in the bank, family still on the chase list |
| `counsellor` | 4 | `counsellor-repeat-incidents` — a pattern rather than an incident |
| `guardian` | 4 | `guardian-outstanding-fees` — what is owed, without ringing the office |

None of them restates the derived baseline: no report here is a count of rows in
a table or a lifecycle the state machine already gives for free.

**The SQL is unverified against a live schema.** The checker validates the shape
(`EML290`–`EML296`) and has no database. `check-reporting-pack.ts` in
`app-and-report-with-ai-tanstack` is what executes each query against a real
generated schema; it was not run in this session, and that is stated in the
delivery note rather than left to be assumed.

> **Gate D — cross-cutting approved**, merged, and put through the §10.0 loop:
> `0 errors · 0 warnings`. No `EML102` survives, so no entity went unwalked.
