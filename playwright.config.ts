/**
 * End-to-end tests for the modelling tool — the application in `packages/web`.
 *
 * The generated applications have their own suites: a `node:test` project the
 * generator emits (`appwithai generate … --run-tests`), and `tests/e2e/wasm/`
 * for the browser stack. This config is only for the tool that writes them.
 *
 * ## The port
 *
 * One value, `E2E_PORT`, feeds both the base URL and the server Playwright
 * starts. It used to be two: the runner script started a dev server on 3000
 * while `baseURL` pointed at 5000, so every test in this directory navigated to
 * a port nothing was listening on. They had never run.
 *
 * ## The server
 *
 * Playwright starts it, waits for `/api/health`, and stops it — rather than the
 * bash script that used to do it, which had `set -e` above a `$?` check, so its
 * teardown and its failure branch were both unreachable.
 *
 * It starts `bun run dev`, which also builds the workspace packages the web app
 * imports (see `scripts/ensure-packages-built.ts`), so a cold checkout works.
 *
 * The production server (`bun run build && bun run start`) would be the better
 * target — it is the artefact a deployment runs — and this config should move to
 * it once it works. Today it does not, for a reason that predates this suite and
 * has nothing to do with it: with a reachable `DATABASE_URL`, the built server
 * loads `@ag-ui/mcp-apps-middleware`, which reaches
 * `@modelcontextprotocol/sdk/dist/cjs/client/sse.js`, which `require()`s
 * `eventsource` — an ESM-only package Bun refuses to `require`. The server then
 * answers 204 to everything, `/api/health` included. Reproduced on `main` with
 * the environment passed explicitly, so it is neither this branch's doing nor a
 * configuration mistake here.
 *
 * `reuseExistingServer` is on outside CI, so a developer with the app already
 * running iterates against it instead of paying for a start per run.
