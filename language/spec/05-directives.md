# EML — Directive Reference

Directives are `%%`-prefixed comment lines that carry generator meaning while
staying invisible to Mermaid renderers.

Each directive has a **status**, declared canonically in its own entry in
`erdwithai-language.json` and repeated in the heading below:

| Status | Meaning |
|--------|---------|
| **compiled** | A shipped reader consumes it and the generated application changes as a result. The `consumedBy` field in the JSON names the file. |
| **validated** | Nothing compiles it yet, but `language/checker.ts` enforces its syntax and cross-references, so a malformed one fails validation instead of being silently dropped. |
| **reserved** | Documented and renderer-safe, with no reader. Writing one is legal and inert; the keyword is held so a later meaning cannot collide with a plain comment. |

All fifteen keywords are reserved words in the language regardless of status —
a `%%` line beginning with one of them is a directive, never a plain comment:

| | | | | |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `%%meta` *(compiled)* | `%%hook` *(compiled)* | `%%step` *(compiled)* | `%%action` *(compiled)* | `%%entity` *(compiled)* |
| `%%field` *(compiled)* | `%%enum` *(compiled)* | `%%category` *(compiled)* | `%%index` *(compiled)* | `%%rule` *(validated)* |
| `%%guard` *(compiled)* | `%%loop` *(compiled)* | `%%rbac` *(compiled)* | `%%trigger` *(validated)* | `%%workflow` *(compiled)* |

---

## `%%meta` — document / section metadata *(compiled)*

```
%%meta <key>: <value>
```

| Key | Meaning |
|-----|---------|
| `name` | Human name of the model/section |
| `kind` | `erd` \| `rules` \| `workflow` (classifies the following diagram) |
| `version` | Semantic version of the model |
| `entity` | Default entity binding for the section |
| `stack` | Target stack hint (`tanstack-start-nestjs` \| `openui5-odatav4`) |

```
%%meta name: CRM Core
%%meta kind: rules
%%meta version: 1.0.0
```

## `%%hook` — lifecycle handler binding *(compiled)*

```
%%hook <type> <handlerName> on <Entity>[<params>]
```

Regex (from `hook-parser.ts`):

```
%%hook\s+(\w+)\s+(\w+)\s+on\s+(\w+)(\[(?:field:\s*\w+(?:\s*,\s*field:\s*\w+)*)?\])?
```

- `type` — one of the 13 hook types (see `03-workflows.md`).
- `params` — optional `[field: a, field: b]`.

```
%%hook beforeCreate hashPassword on User
%%hook beforeCreate generateSlug on Post[field: slug]
```

## `%%step` — bind a flowchart node to an executable step *(compiled)*

```
%%step <nodeId> <stepType> <key>: <value> ...
```

Only meaningful inside a `%%workflow ... kind: saga` section. `nodeId` names a
node in that flowchart; the flowchart's edges give the running order. Each
`%%step` becomes one `bpmn:serviceTask` in the seeded workflow definition.

- `stepType` — `UpdateEntity` | `CreateEntity` | `DeleteEntity` | `Formula` |
  `REST` | `Agent`
- properties — space-separated `key: value`. A value runs to the next `<key>:`
  token, so it may contain spaces. **`fields` carries JSON and must be the last
  key on the line.**

```
%%step B Formula target: baseDays operation: set value: 3
%%step C Formula target: resolutionDays source: baseDays operation: multiply operand: 7
%%step D CreateEntity entity: Capa as: newCapaId fields: {"title":"CAPA","status":"open"}
%%step E UpdateEntity field: status value: escalated
%%step F UpdateEntity entity: Capa targetSource: newCapaId field: effectiveness_metric source: resolutionDays
%%step G DeleteEntity entity: Capa targetSource: supersededCapaId
```

Steps share a context — the triggering record's columns plus every variable an
earlier step published (`as` on `CreateEntity`, `target` on `Formula`). Naming
one in `source` or `targetSource` is how a later step reaches a row an earlier
step created.

Per-type required properties and the row-targeting rules are in
[`03-workflows.md`](03-workflows.md#3-saga-workflows--multi-step-processes) and
declared canonically under `workflowConstructs.stepNodes` in
`appwithai-language.json`.

## `%%action` — declare a rule's side effect *(compiled)*

```
%%action <name> <actionType> when: <expr> <key>: <value> ...
```

Only meaningful inside a business-rules section. A section that carries
`%%action` directives compiles to a GoRules **decision table** — one row per
directive — instead of a node graph.

That difference is the whole point. The node-graph form a rules flowchart
normally compiles to carries no outputs, so the rules engine finds no actions in
it: a model-declared rule could decide, but never act. A decision table is the
shape the engine reads `action`, `message`, `ruleId` and `workflowName` from, so
a section declaring actions is compiled as one.

- `name` — identifies the row; also the fallback message text.
- `actionType` — lands in the `action` output. `trigger-workflow` and
  `validation-error` are the two the generated runtime acts on.
- `when:` — a Zen expression over the triggering record. Omitted means `true`,
  which fires on every write.
- remaining keys — space-separated `key: value`, each value running to the next
  `<key>:` token, so a value may contain spaces.

The recognised property keys map to decision-table output columns:

| Key | Output field | Used by |
|-----|--------------|---------|
| `message` | `message` | `validation-error` — the text the write fails with |
| `workflow` | `workflowName` | `trigger-workflow` — names the workflow to start |
| `field` / `value` | `field` / `value` | stamping a column |
| `targetEntity` / `linkField` | `targetEntity` / `linkField` | acting on a related row |

The table uses `hitPolicy: collect`, because several rows may match one write —
a rule that escalates *and* stamps a field is ordinary. Every declared output
column is written in every row, blank where unused: zen-engine yields *no result
at all* for a row with a missing cell, so an omitted column would make the whole
rule evaluate to nothing.

```
%%action escalate trigger-workflow when: severity == "critical" workflow: CriticalDeviationEscalation
%%action requireCause validation-error when: root_cause == null message: A root cause is required
```

**This is how a model-declared rule reaches a model-declared saga**: the rule's
`when` decides, and its `trigger-workflow` action names the workflow by the name
its `%%workflow` directive gave it.

## `%%entity` — entity-level metadata *(compiled: `help:`/`description:` and `parent:`)*

```
%%entity <Name> <key>: <value>
```

| Key | Meaning |
|-----|---------|
| `prefix` | `bus` \| `sys` table prefix *(validated)* |
| `audited` | `true` \| `false` — emit audit trail *(validated)* |
| `softDelete` | `true` \| `false` — use `deleted_at` *(validated)* |
| `label` | UI display label *(validated)* |
| `icon` | UI icon name *(validated)* |
| `help` | Human-readable description — stored in `sys_table.description` and used as the opening paragraph of that entity's section in `manual.html`. Required on every entity, and it has to be domain knowledge rather than the name again — see below *(compiled)* |
| `parent` | This entity is a **line item** of the one named — see below *(compiled)* |

```
%%entity Order audited: true
%%entity Account prefix: bus
%%entity Lead help: A prospective customer contact who has shown interest but has not yet been qualified by a sales representative.
```

The `help:` value runs to end-of-line. It is the only prose an author controls for an entity; every other part of that section in the manual (fields, relationships, lifecycle, rules, RBAC) is derived automatically from the model structure. An entity with no `help:` gets a placeholder sentence in the manual and nothing in the form — write one for every entity.

### `parent:` — a line item, and where the dictionary puts it

```
%%entity InvoiceLine parent: Invoice
```

Some entities have no life away from their owner: an invoice line, an order
line, a prescription item. **The ERD cannot say so.** `InvoiceLine.invoice_id`
and `Invoice.patient_id` are both a foreign key with a relationship behind it,
and nothing in Mermaid distinguishes a line that means nothing without its
invoice from a patient who means a great deal without one. This directive is the
only place a model can say which it is.

Decide it with three questions, in this order:

1. Would a list of these records, *away from their owner*, be useful to anyone?
   A screen of every invoice line ever written is not a screen anyone opens.
   If no — it is a child.
2. Does the row's identity depend on the owner? "Line 1 of invoice 7", not
   "line 1". If yes — it is a child.
3. Would deleting the owner make the row meaningless? If yes — it is a child.

A reference is the opposite on all three. Most foreign keys are references.

| | Parent | Child |
|---|---|---|
| `sys_window` | its own | **none** |
| Dashboard | a card | **no card — not navigable** |
| `sys_tab` | `tab_level: 0` | `tab_level: 1`, in the *parent's* window |
| Reached by | opening the window | opening a parent record |

The tab links on the child's own foreign key back to the parent — the one
already in the ERD. It is marked `sys_column.is_parent` and stored as
`sys_tab.link_column_id`. Do not declare a second column for it, and do not drop
the relationship line: the directive names the parent, the ERD still draws the
edge.

**Leave a child out of `%%category`.** A category is the dashboard's grouping
and a child has no card, so naming one there asks for a card the dictionary will
not create (`EML150`).

A child is still a real table with real rules, access control and a form. Only
its *placement* changes.

Five codes police it:

| Code | Severity | Fires when |
|---|---|---|
| `EML147` | error | the parent is not declared, or an entity names itself |
| `EML148` | error | the child has no foreign key back — nothing for the tab to link on |
| `EML149` | info | an entity is *shaped* like a line item and declares no `parent:` |
| `EML150` | warning | a declared child is named in a `%%category` |
| `EML155` | info | a line item whose parent is itself a line item |

`EML155` is an `info` too. The dictionary has two levels — a top-level entity and
the line items in its window — so a line item whose parent is itself a line item
is generated as a top-level entity: it keeps its foreign key and gains a window
and a dashboard card, and the parent's page does not list it. The checker says so
because `parent:` reads like a request for a tab. Remove the directive to accept
that, or point it at the top-level entity to get the tab.

`EML149` is an `info` and never an error, because the three questions above are
about the business and not about the document — the checker can only name the
candidate and the column a tab would link on. It fires on two shapes, both of
which also require the foreign key: an entity whose name *begins* with a
declared entity's name (`InvoiceLine`/`Invoice`, `TeamMember`/`Team`), and an
entity whose name *ends* in a line-item noun — `Line`, `LineItem`, `Item`,
`Detail`, `Entry`, `Row` — with a foreign key resolving to a declared entity
(`RecommendationItem` under `InvestmentRecommendation`). Answer it either way:
declare the parent, or leave the entity alone because it is a thing in its own
right.

## `%%field` — extended field metadata *(compiled: the `enum:` key only)*

```
%%field <Entity>.<attr> <key>: <value>
```

| Key | Meaning |
|-----|---------|
| `enum` | Reference a `%%enum` for allowed values |
| `ui` | Control override (select, textarea, switch, …) |
| `default` | Default value |
| `min` / `max` | Numeric or length bounds |
| `help` | Field help text |
| `format` | Display/validation format |

```
%%field Order.status enum: OrderStatus
%%field Product.price min: 0
%%field User.bio ui: textarea
%%field Order.placed_at help: When the customer committed, not when we shipped.
```

`enum:` and `help:` are the two keys a compiler reads; the rest are validated
only. `help:` has **two** consumers: `sys_column.description`, which the
generated form prints as hint text beneath the control, and `manual.html`, where
it fills the "Purpose" column of the field table. A field with no `help:` shows a
dash in the manual and no hint in the form. Write help on every field, not only
the ambiguous ones — the manual has no other way to explain what a field is for.

### The manual and what comes from help text vs. the model

The generated `manual.html` is built entirely from the `ParsedModel` —
`packages/generator/src/manual/index.ts`, zero runtime dependencies. Each
entity section has five subsections:

| Subsection | Source | Needs `help:`? |
|---|---|---|
| Opening paragraph | `%%entity <Name> help:` | Yes — blank if omitted |
| **Fields** — name, control type, constraints, enumerated values, purpose | Model attributes; purpose from `%%field <E>.<f> help:` | Yes for "Purpose" column |
| **Relationships** — what this entity links to and from | `erDiagram` FK declarations | No — auto-derived |
| **Lifecycle** — state machine table (From / To / Event) | `%%workflow … kind: state` transitions | No — auto-derived |
| **Rules and automation** — decision rules, sagas, hooks | `%%rule`, `%%workflow kind: saga`, `%%hook` | No — auto-derived |
| **Access** — which roles may read / create / update / delete | `%%rbac` directives | No — auto-derived |

The global sections (all rules, all processes, how the application was built) are
also entirely automatic. **The model author's only lever is `%%entity help:` and
`%%field help:`** — everything else the manual says about the application is
derived from the model's structure.

### Help is not optional, and it must be domain knowledge

Three codes police it, all warnings:

| Code | Fires when |
|---|---|
| `EML152` | an entity carries no `%%entity … help:` at all |
| `EML153` | an entity has columns with no `%%field … help:` — reported once, naming them |
| `EML151` | help that restates its own subject rather than describing it |

They are three of the six **dictionary-completeness** codes. The other three are
`EML119` (a reference column with no `FK` modifier), `EML146` (a status, state or
stage column with no `%%field … enum:` binding) and `EML154` (a `%%category` with
no `name:`). The six are warnings by severity and gaps by consequence. Every
Application Dictionary value is mandatory in the model, `audit-model.mjs` fails a
model that carries any of the six, and the checker's closing verdict names them
separately from the advisory warnings. Plan each value before writing it, and
review the whole file again after a clean run: a delivered model carries none of
them (`applicationDictionary.completeness` in `appwithai-language.json`).

`EML151` is the one worth dwelling on, because coverage can be complete and the
help still worthless. A published model once carried 642 field descriptions of
which 699 lines in total were of this kind:

```
Bad:   %%field HouseholdMember.household_id help: Household id for HouseholdMember.
Good:  %%field HouseholdMember.household_id help: The family this membership is in. Listed inside the household's own screen — a membership away from its household is not something anybody looks up.

Bad:   %%entity Address help: Address is a business record in the wealth-management platform.
Good:  %%entity Address help: A postal address belonging to a party, kept as its own record because a party has several — registered, correspondence, often an overseas one — and because a change of address is a KYC event that has to be evidenced rather than typed over the old one.
```

The first of each pair passes a coverage check and tells the reader nothing they
could not already see. **Help is where the business lands in the model**, and it
is compiled, so the difference between the two reaches every form, every
dictionary row and every page of the manual.

The three shapes `EML151` reports are `Unique identifier for X`, the column name
in prose (`Status for Client`), and a template sentence (`X is a business record
in …`). It is deliberately narrow: real help that happens to be short — *The day
this offer expires.* — is not a restatement and does not fire.

**The primary key needs no help** and `EML153` does not ask for any: it is a
generated uuid, read-only on every form, and the only sentence anybody could
write about it restates its name. Writing one anyway is what `EML151` reports.

### Authoring guidance for `%%field help:`

Good help text answers: *what business purpose does this field serve, and what
value is expected here?*

- One or two sentences. Avoid restating the field name.
- Name the business decision or event the field records:
  `%%field Contract.signed_at help: The date and time the counterparty returned a signed copy. Left blank until signature is confirmed.`
- Describe the domain constraint, not the database constraint:
  `%%field Invoice.due_date help: Payment must be received by this date or a late-fee workflow starts automatically.`
- For enum fields, explain what each value means:
  `%%field Lead.status help: new — just entered; contacted — first outreach made; qualified — sales accepted; lost — no longer pursuing.`
- For FK fields, explain the relationship in business terms:
  `%%field Order.account_id help: The company this order belongs to. Must match an approved account before shipping.`

A field whose purpose is truly self-evident (`%%field User.email`) still benefits
from a sentence when there are business rules attached to it — the manual is the
only place those rules are explained in plain language.

## `%%enum` — named enumeration *(compiled)*

```
%%enum <Name>: <value1>, <value2>, ...
```

Reusable by `%%field enum:` and by state-workflow states.

```
%%enum OrderStatus: draft, submitted, approved, shipped, cancelled
%%enum Priority: low, medium, high, urgent
```

## `%%category` — group entities for the dashboard *(compiled)*

```
%%category name: <Name>; description: <text>; icon: <LucideIcon>; color: <#hex>; seq: <n>; default: true; entities: <A>, <B>
```

Groups business entities into a named Application Dictionary category. The
generated dashboard renders one block per category, ordered by name, and
`/admin/categories` maintains them.

Only `name` is required; the remaining keys are `;`-separated and may appear in
any order. `entities` lists the entity names the category holds. `default: true`
marks the category that receives anything left unassigned — at most one document
may declare it.

A model that declares no categories gets a single `General` default holding
every entity, so the directive is optional.

**A line item does not belong in one.** `%%entity <Child> parent: <Parent>`
takes the child's dashboard card away, so listing it in a category asks for a
card that will never be created. Reported as `EML150`.

**`name:` is required, and there is no shorthand.** `%%category Sources:
DataSource, SchemaEntity` reads perfectly well and declares nothing:
`category.parser.ts` requires a `name:` key and skips the line without one, so
the grouping is lost and its entities fall into the default `General` category.
The model still checks clean — the directive is a comment Mermaid ignores and a
directive the generator ignores too — which is why `EML154` reports it.

```
%%category name: Compound Registry; description: Structures and aliases; icon: FlaskConical; color: #6366f1; entities: Compound, CompoundAlias
%%category name: People and Teams; default: true; entities: User, Team
```

## `%%section` — lay a form out in sections of two-column rows *(compiled)*

```
%%section entity: <Entity>; name: <Label>; help: <text>; rows: <column>, <column> | <column> | …; collapsed: true
```

A column says what is stored; a field says it is on the screen; a section says
**where, and beside what**. Each `%%section` line is one headed section of one
entity's form:

| Key | Required | Compiled to |
|---|---|---|
| `entity` | yes | the entity's tab |
| `name` | yes | `sys_field_group.name` — the section heading |
| `help` | completeness (`EML177`) | `sys_field_group.description` — the sentence under the heading |
| `rows` | yes | each field's `sys_field_group_id`, `seq_no`, `is_same_line`, `column_span` |
| `collapsed` | no | `sys_field_group.is_collapsed_by_default` |

`rows` separates rows with `|` and the columns of a row with `,`. **A row holds
one or two columns.** Two sit side by side; one spans the full width — the place
for a `text` column, an address, or a reference whose label is long. Sections
render in the order they are declared and fields in row order; repeating a
section's `entity` and `name` continues it on the next line. `help` may contain
`;`; no other value may.

**It is mandatory.** Every entity declares its sections, and every column but
the primary key is placed in exactly one row. An entity without sections is
generated as one flat, unheaded list in declared order (`EML170`); a column no
row names is put in a collapsed `Other` section at the end (`EML172`, which the
fixer repairs by appending it to the last section — a repair, not a design).

How to lay a form out:

- **Pair what is filled in together** — `first_name, last_name`; `start_date,
  end_date`; `quantity, unit_price`; a reference beside the status it moves
  through.
- **Name a section for what the person is doing**, not the kind of column:
  *Identity, Contact, Terms, Delivery* — never *References, Dates, Numbers*.
- **Open with what identifies the record** — the columns its display value is
  built from, and the one or two someone checks first.
- **Two to six rows a section.** Eight columns is two or three sections.
- **Last, and `collapsed: true`:** what is rarely touched — internal notes,
  integration references, administrator-only figures.
- **Line items too.** A `parent:` entity's sections are what its own form shows
  when a row is opened from the parent's tab.

| Code | Severity | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `EML170` | warning · completeness | the entity declares no `%%section` |
| `EML171` | error | a `%%section` without `entity:`, `name:` or `rows:` |
| `EML172` | warning · completeness · auto-fix | columns placed in no row |
| `EML173` | error | the entity is not declared |
| `EML174` | error · auto-fix | a row with more than two columns |
| `EML175` | warning · auto-fix | a column placed twice |
| `EML176` | error | a row names a column the entity lacks, or its primary key |
| `EML177` | warning · completeness | a section with no `help:`, or help that restates its name |
| `EML178` | warning · auto-fix | a row places the state field — it is shown read-only in the form's header and always in the list grid, never in the body |

```
%%section entity: Order; name: Order; help: Who placed the order and when. Where it stands is shown in the header.; rows: order_number, order_date | customer_id
%%section entity: Order; name: Delivery; help: Where the goods go and how they travel there.; rows: shipping_address | carrier, tracking_number
%%section entity: Order; name: Notes; help: Anything the next person handling this order should know.; rows: notes; collapsed: true
```

## `%%index` — database index *(compiled)*

```
%%index <Entity>(<attr>[, <attr>...]) [unique]
```

```
%%index Contact(email) unique
%%index Order(company_id, status)
```

## `%%rule` — bind a decision flow *(validated)*

```
%%rule <name> on <Entity> event: <lifecycle> priority: <n>
```

Ties a business-rules section to an entity + lifecycle event; `priority` orders
multiple rules.

```
%%rule pricing on Order event: beforeCreate priority: 10
```

## `%%loop` — repeat while a rule holds *(compiled)*

```
%%loop <loopId> while: <field> <operator> <value> max: <n>
%%step <nodeId> in: <loopId>
```

The steps naming a loop run in order and repeat for as long as the check passes,
ending the first time it fails. The check is re-read before every pass against
the current record, so a step inside the loop is what ends it. Operators are the
same eleven as automation conditions. Loops do not nest.

```
%%loop L1 while: retry_count lt 5 max: 10
%%step s1 in: L1
%%step s2 in: L1
```

`max:` is **required** — the passes after which the loop is abandoned and the run
marked `FAILED`. There is no default: the right ceiling depends on the work, not
the engine. A loop whose check reads a field no member writes is refused at
compile time, as is one with no `max`.

Members are drawn as a Mermaid `subgraph L1[Repeat while …]`, and a step inside
can read `{{L1.iteration}}` — the 1-based pass number. Full semantics in
[`03-workflows.md`](03-workflows.md#loops--repeating-steps-while-a-rule-holds).

## `%%guard` — automation condition *(compiled)*

```
%%guard <field> <operator> <jsonValue>
```

A check that must pass for an automation's steps to run. All of an automation's
guards must pass; there is no OR. See
[03-workflows.md](03-workflows.md#conditions) for the operators.

```
%%guard status eq "open"
%%guard order.total gt 1000
```

## `%%rbac` — restrict an operation *(compiled)*

```
%%rbac <roleExpr> on <Entity>.<op>
```

`roleExpr` uses `role:<name>` with `|` for OR — `role:sales|manager` and
`role:sales|role:manager` both work, as does a bare `admin`.

### It restricts; it does not grant

A target no directive mentions is **open** to any authenticated caller. One or
more directives close it to the union of the roles they name.

That direction matters. The opposite reading — everything denied until granted —
would lock every user out of every existing model on the next regeneration, and
a model that says nothing about permissions belongs to an author who has not got
to them yet, not one who wants everything forbidden.

A **master role** (`sys_role.is_master_role`) bypasses every rule. Role names are
matched **case-insensitively**: seeded roles are title-cased (`Manager`) and
directives are written lower-case (`role:manager`), and an exact match would
make such a rule unsatisfiable — locking out precisely the people it was written
to admit, invisibly, until someone is refused.

### `<op>` is a CRUD operation — never a transition

**CRUD**: `create` `read` `update` `delete`, or `*` for all four. Aliases are
accepted (`insert`/`add`, `view`/`select`/`list`, `edit`/`write`/`modify`,
`remove`/`destroy`).

```
%%rbac role:admin on Order.delete
%%rbac role:sales|manager on Deal.update
%%rbac role:admin on Customer.*
```

**A transition is not an operation a role can hold.** The state field an entity's
`stateDiagram-v2` drives is system-managed: no person changes it, only background
workflows do (`spec/03-workflows.md`). So a name that matches a transition event —
`%%rbac role:sales_manager on Quote.approve` — is `EML215`, and the fixer deletes
the line. To say who may approve, restrict who may record the approval: the
column the approval rule reads is written under `Quote.update`.

### `read` decides which functional role an entity belongs to

Every other operation only refuses a write. `read` is the one that changes what a
role *sees*: an entity a role may not read is absent from that role's navigation
entirely — no menu entry, no dashboard card, no lookup — because a menu full of
entries that answer `403` is a worse application than a shorter one.

That makes one `read` directive per entity the way a model says who an entity
belongs to:

```
%%rbac role:sales_rep|sales_manager|support_agent on Account.read
%%rbac role:sales_rep|sales_manager on Opportunity.read
%%rbac role:support_agent|support_manager on SupportCase.read
%%rbac role:marketing_manager on Campaign.read
```

A model is expected to name **every** entity on at least one such directive, so
every entity belongs to somebody. Declaring none leaves every entity visible to
every signed-in caller, which is what every model did before this rule existed —
the fallback, not the target.

Three things follow, and each has caught a model out:

- **A role that may act on an entity must also be able to read it.** A rule
  letting `sales_manager` run `Opportunity.close_won` is useless if the
  `Opportunity.read` line does not name `sales_manager`.
- **Overlap is normal and is one line.** `Account` belongs to sales, marketing
  and support in most businesses; name all three. Two directives on one target
  merge, so either spelling works.
- **Do not reach for `.*` to express ownership.** It restricts creating,
  updating and deleting to the same list, and it *merges with* rather than
  overrides the narrower `update` rules elsewhere in the document — widening
  them.

### One account per role, seeded

Every role a directive names is created, and one account is seeded holding it,
beside the administrator who bypasses everything and a role-less `User`.

This is not a convenience. The administrator is exempt from every rule the model
wrote, so an application whose only account is the administrator is one whose
access control cannot be looked at. Both stacks derive the list from
`packages/generator/src/rbac/roles.ts`, and both sign-in screens print it with
the number of entities each role can see — `Support Agent · 5 of 17` is the
invitation to check.

### What it compiles to

| | |
|---|---|
| CRUD rules | `sys_operation_access` (table, operation, role) |
| Enforcement | `EntityAccessGuard`, applied to the generated `/bus` CRUD routes |
| Roles | every role a directive names is created in `sys_role`, with one account holding it |
| `read` rules | additionally narrow the dictionary window scope and the entity navigation |

Rules carry `entity_type = 'D'` (declared by the model) and are replaced on every
regeneration. Rules an administrator adds in the running application are marked
`'U'` and survive — the same ownership split the workflow definitions use.

### Validation

`EML210` malformed syntax · `EML211` names no role · `EML212` suspicious role
expression · `EML213` undeclared entity · `EML214` the target is not a CRUD operation ·
`EML215` the target is a transition — a state is changed only by background
workflows.

All but `EML212` are **errors**, not warnings: a `%%rbac` rule that does not
compile is not a rule that does nothing — it is an access restriction its author
believes is in place and is not.

## `%%trigger` — event / schedule source *(validated)*

```
%%trigger <source> -> <handler> on <Entity>
```

`source` forms: `cron:<expr>`, `webhook:<name>`, `message:<topic>`.

```
%%trigger cron:0 0 * * * -> expireQuotes on Quote
%%trigger webhook:payment -> markPaid on Order
```

## `%%workflow` — name & classify a workflow *(compiled)*

```
%%workflow <name> entity: <Entity> kind: <hook|state|saga> [trigger: automatic|rule]
           [operation: CREATE|UPDATE|DELETE|ALL]
```

`trigger` and `operation` apply to `kind: saga` only. `automatic` (the default)
runs the workflow on every matching write; `rule` runs it only when a business
rule emits a `trigger-workflow` action naming it, so the rule's condition is what
decides. `operation` defaults to `CREATE` and is only consulted for `automatic`.

```
%%workflow OrderFulfilment entity: Order kind: state
%%workflow SignupFlow entity: User kind: hook
%%workflow CheckoutSaga entity: Order kind: saga trigger: rule
```
