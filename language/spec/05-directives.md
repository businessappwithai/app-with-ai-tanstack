# EML — Directive Reference

Directives are `%%`-prefixed comment lines that carry generator meaning while
staying invisible to Mermaid renderers.

Each directive has a **status**, declared canonically in its own entry in
`erdwithai-language.json` and repeated in the heading below:

| Status | Meaning |
|--------|---------|
| **compiled** | A shipped reader consumes it and the generated application changes as a result. The `consumedBy` field in the JSON names the file. |
| **validated** | Nothing compiles it yet, but `language/checker.ts` enforces its syntax and cross-references, so a malformed one fails validation instead of being silently dropped. |
| **reserved** | Documented and renderer-safe, with no reader. Writing one is legal and inert; the keyword is held so a later meaning cannot collide with a plain comment. |

All fifteen keywords are reserved words in the language regardless of status —
a `%%` line beginning with one of them is a directive, never a plain comment:

| | | | | |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `%%meta` *(compiled)* | `%%hook` *(compiled)* | `%%step` *(compiled)* | `%%action` *(compiled)* | `%%entity` *(validated)* |
| `%%field` *(compiled)* | `%%enum` *(compiled)* | `%%category` *(compiled)* | `%%index` *(compiled)* | `%%rule` *(validated)* |
| `%%guard` *(compiled)* | `%%loop` *(compiled)* | `%%rbac` *(reserved)* | `%%trigger` *(validated)* | `%%workflow` *(compiled)* |

---

## `%%meta` — document / section metadata *(compiled)*

```
%%meta <key>: <value>
```

| Key | Meaning |
|-----|---------|
| `name` | Human name of the model/section |
| `kind` | `erd` \| `rules` \| `workflow` (classifies the following diagram) |
| `version` | Semantic version of the model |
| `entity` | Default entity binding for the section |
| `stack` | Target stack hint (`tanstack-start-nestjs` \| `openui5-odatav4`) |

```
%%meta name: CRM Core
%%meta kind: rules
%%meta version: 1.0.0
```

## `%%hook` — lifecycle handler binding *(compiled)*

```
%%hook <type> <handlerName> on <Entity>[<params>]
```

Regex (from `hook-parser.ts`):

```
%%hook\s+(\w+)\s+(\w+)\s+on\s+(\w+)(\[(?:field:\s*\w+(?:\s*,\s*field:\s*\w+)*)?\])?
```

- `type` — one of the 13 hook types (see `03-workflows.md`).
- `params` — optional `[field: a, field: b]`.

```
%%hook beforeCreate hashPassword on User
%%hook beforeCreate generateSlug on Post[field: slug]
```

## `%%step` — bind a flowchart node to an executable step *(compiled)*

```
%%step <nodeId> <stepType> <key>: <value> ...
```

Only meaningful inside a `%%workflow ... kind: saga` section. `nodeId` names a
node in that flowchart; the flowchart's edges give the running order. Each
`%%step` becomes one `bpmn:serviceTask` in the seeded workflow definition.

- `stepType` — `UpdateEntity` | `CreateEntity` | `DeleteEntity` | `Formula` |
  `REST` | `Agent`
- properties — space-separated `key: value`. A value runs to the next `<key>:`
  token, so it may contain spaces. **`fields` carries JSON and must be the last
  key on the line.**

```
%%step B Formula target: baseDays operation: set value: 3
%%step C Formula target: resolutionDays source: baseDays operation: multiply operand: 7
%%step D CreateEntity entity: Capa as: newCapaId fields: {"title":"CAPA","status":"open"}
%%step E UpdateEntity field: status value: escalated
%%step F UpdateEntity entity: Capa targetSource: newCapaId field: effectiveness_metric source: resolutionDays
%%step G DeleteEntity entity: Capa targetSource: supersededCapaId
```

Steps share a context — the triggering record's columns plus every variable an
earlier step published (`as` on `CreateEntity`, `target` on `Formula`). Naming
one in `source` or `targetSource` is how a later step reaches a row an earlier
step created.

Per-type required properties and the row-targeting rules are in
[`03-workflows.md`](03-workflows.md#3-saga-workflows--multi-step-processes) and
declared canonically under `workflowConstructs.stepNodes` in
`erdwithai-language.json`.

## `%%action` — declare a rule's side effect *(compiled)*

```
%%action <name> <actionType> when: <expr> <key>: <value> ...
```

Only meaningful inside a business-rules section. A section that carries
`%%action` directives compiles to a GoRules **decision table** — one row per
directive — instead of a node graph.

That difference is the whole point. The node-graph form a rules flowchart
normally compiles to carries no outputs, so the rules engine finds no actions in
it: a model-declared rule could decide, but never act. A decision table is the
shape the engine reads `action`, `message`, `ruleId` and `workflowName` from, so
a section declaring actions is compiled as one.

- `name` — identifies the row; also the fallback message text.
- `actionType` — lands in the `action` output. `trigger-workflow` and
  `validation-error` are the two the generated runtime acts on.
- `when:` — a Zen expression over the triggering record. Omitted means `true`,
  which fires on every write.
- remaining keys — space-separated `key: value`, each value running to the next
  `<key>:` token, so a value may contain spaces.

The recognised property keys map to decision-table output columns:

| Key | Output field | Used by |
|-----|--------------|---------|
| `message` | `message` | `validation-error` — the text the write fails with |
| `workflow` | `workflowName` | `trigger-workflow` — names the workflow to start |
| `field` / `value` | `field` / `value` | stamping a column |
| `targetEntity` / `linkField` | `targetEntity` / `linkField` | acting on a related row |

The table uses `hitPolicy: collect`, because several rows may match one write —
a rule that escalates *and* stamps a field is ordinary. Every declared output
column is written in every row, blank where unused: zen-engine yields *no result
at all* for a row with a missing cell, so an omitted column would make the whole
rule evaluate to nothing.

```
%%action escalate trigger-workflow when: severity == "critical" workflow: CriticalDeviationEscalation
%%action requireCause validation-error when: root_cause == null message: A root cause is required
```

**This is how a model-declared rule reaches a model-declared saga**: the rule's
`when` decides, and its `trigger-workflow` action names the workflow by the name
its `%%workflow` directive gave it.

## `%%entity` — entity-level metadata *(validated)*

```
%%entity <Name> <key>: <value>
```

| Key | Meaning |
|-----|---------|
| `prefix` | `bus` \| `sys` table prefix |
| `audited` | `true` \| `false` — emit audit trail |
| `softDelete` | `true` \| `false` — use `deleted_at` |
| `label` | UI display label |
| `icon` | UI icon name |

```
%%entity Order audited: true
%%entity Account prefix: bus
```

## `%%field` — extended field metadata *(compiled: the `enum:` key only)*

```
%%field <Entity>.<attr> <key>: <value>
```

| Key | Meaning |
|-----|---------|
| `enum` | Reference a `%%enum` for allowed values |
| `ui` | Control override (select, textarea, switch, …) |
| `default` | Default value |
| `min` / `max` | Numeric or length bounds |
| `help` | Field help text |
| `format` | Display/validation format |

```
%%field Order.status enum: OrderStatus
%%field Product.price min: 0
%%field User.bio ui: textarea
```

## `%%enum` — named enumeration *(compiled)*

```
%%enum <Name>: <value1>, <value2>, ...
```

Reusable by `%%field enum:` and by state-workflow states.

```
%%enum OrderStatus: draft, submitted, approved, shipped, cancelled
%%enum Priority: low, medium, high, urgent
```

## `%%category` — group entities for the dashboard *(compiled)*

```
%%category name: <Name>; description: <text>; icon: <LucideIcon>; color: <#hex>; seq: <n>; default: true; entities: <A>, <B>
```

Groups business entities into a named Application Dictionary category. The
generated dashboard renders one block per category, ordered by name, and
`/admin/categories` maintains them.

Only `name` is required; the remaining keys are `;`-separated and may appear in
any order. `entities` lists the entity names the category holds. `default: true`
marks the category that receives anything left unassigned — at most one document
may declare it.

A model that declares no categories gets a single `General` default holding
every entity, so the directive is optional.

```
%%category name: Compound Registry; description: Structures and aliases; icon: FlaskConical; color: #6366f1; entities: Compound, CompoundAlias
%%category name: People and Teams; default: true; entities: User, Team
```

## `%%index` — database index *(compiled)*

```
%%index <Entity>(<attr>[, <attr>...]) [unique]
```

```
%%index Contact(email) unique
%%index Order(company_id, status)
```

## `%%rule` — bind a decision flow *(validated)*

```
%%rule <name> on <Entity> event: <lifecycle> priority: <n>
```

Ties a business-rules section to an entity + lifecycle event; `priority` orders
multiple rules.

```
%%rule pricing on Order event: beforeCreate priority: 10
```

## `%%loop` — repeat while a rule holds *(compiled)*

```
%%loop <loopId> while: <field> <operator> <value> max: <n>
%%step <nodeId> in: <loopId>
```

The steps naming a loop run in order and repeat for as long as the check passes,
ending the first time it fails. The check is re-read before every pass against
the current record, so a step inside the loop is what ends it. Operators are the
same eleven as automation conditions. Loops do not nest.

```
%%loop L1 while: retry_count lt 5 max: 10
%%step s1 in: L1
%%step s2 in: L1
```

`max:` is **required** — the passes after which the loop is abandoned and the run
marked `FAILED`. There is no default: the right ceiling depends on the work, not
the engine. A loop whose check reads a field no member writes is refused at
compile time, as is one with no `max`.

Members are drawn as a Mermaid `subgraph L1[Repeat while …]`, and a step inside
can read `{{L1.iteration}}` — the 1-based pass number. Full semantics in
[`03-workflows.md`](03-workflows.md#loops--repeating-steps-while-a-rule-holds).

## `%%guard` — automation condition *(compiled)*

```
%%guard <field> <operator> <jsonValue>
```

A check that must pass for an automation's steps to run. All of an automation's
guards must pass; there is no OR. See
[03-workflows.md](03-workflows.md#conditions) for the operators.

```
%%guard status eq "open"
%%guard order.total gt 1000
```

## `%%rbac` — RBAC guard *(reserved)*

```
%%rbac <roleExpr> on <Entity>.<op>
```

`roleExpr` uses `role:<name>` with `|` for OR. Integrates with core
`rbac.types`.

```
%%rbac role:admin on Order.delete
%%rbac role:sales|manager on Deal.update
```

> Spelled `%%guard` before that keyword was needed unambiguously for automation
> conditions. This sense had no shipped parser and no stored data, so it is the
> side that moved — renaming the condition form would have meant rewriting every
> stored automation. A model still carrying `%%guard role:… on <Entity>.<op>` is
> skipped by the automation reader rather than parsed as a check on a field
> called `role:admin`, which could never pass and would silently disable the
> automation.

## `%%trigger` — event / schedule source *(validated)*

```
%%trigger <source> -> <handler> on <Entity>
```

`source` forms: `cron:<expr>`, `webhook:<name>`, `message:<topic>`.

```
%%trigger cron:0 0 * * * -> expireQuotes on Quote
%%trigger webhook:payment -> markPaid on Order
```

## `%%workflow` — name & classify a workflow *(compiled)*

```
%%workflow <name> entity: <Entity> kind: <hook|state|saga> [trigger: automatic|rule]
           [operation: CREATE|UPDATE|DELETE|ALL]
```

`trigger` and `operation` apply to `kind: saga` only. `automatic` (the default)
runs the workflow on every matching write; `rule` runs it only when a business
rule emits a `trigger-workflow` action naming it, so the rule's condition is what
decides. `operation` defaults to `CREATE` and is only consulted for `automatic`.

```
%%workflow OrderFulfilment entity: Order kind: state
%%workflow SignupFlow entity: User kind: hook
%%workflow CheckoutSaga entity: Order kind: saga trigger: rule
```
