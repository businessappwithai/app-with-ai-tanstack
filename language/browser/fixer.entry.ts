/**
 * The EML fixer, as one file a web page can load.
 *
 * The companion to `checker.entry.ts`, and the same argument: `language/fixer.ts`
 * is a command that reads a `.mmd.error` report, rewrites the `.mmd` beside it
 * and re-runs the checker in a subprocess. The repair itself is `applyFixes` —
 * a string and a list of diagnostics in, a repaired string out.
 *
 * What this adds beyond re-exporting it is `checkAndFix`: the loop between the
 * two, which every caller wants and which is easy to get subtly wrong. Repair,
 * then **check again** — a fix can uncover a problem the original error was
 * masking, so subtracting the repaired codes from the first report would be
 * describing a document that no longer exists. `packages/generator/src/pipeline/
 * review-model.ts` makes the same loop for the generator; this is that loop for
 * a browser, over the same two functions.
 *
 * It repairs five codes and no more. Everything else needs a person or a model
 * to decide what was meant, which is why `checkAndFix` reports what it could not
 * touch rather than guessing.
