description: Start the AppWithAI modelling tool (the TanStack Start web app on :3000) in a fresh cloud container — Postgres, bun install, the admin account, the dev server — and drive it in Chromium. Use when asked to run the app, show a screenshot of it, or check a change in the real UI.

# Run the modelling tool

Use `bun`, never `npm`/`pnpm`. The tool is `packages/web`; generated apps are a different thing (see `generate-and-run-app`).

## Start it, in this order

1. `bun install --frozen-lockfile` — with no `node_modules`, `bunx biome` and `type-check` lie (see `ship-checks`).
2. **Postgres 16** is installed but not running. As root, put the data directory outside `/tmp/claude-*` (the `postgres` user cannot write there):
   ```bash
   B=/usr/lib/postgresql/16/bin; D=/var/tmp/pgdata
   mkdir -p $D && chown postgres $D
   su postgres -c "$B/initdb -D $D -A trust" && su postgres -c "$B/pg_ctl -D $D -o '-k /tmp' -l $D/log start"
   psql -h /tmp -U postgres -c "create role appwithai superuser login password 'password'" -c "create database appwithai owner appwithai"
   ```
   Use full paths to `pg_ctl`/`initdb`; `su` resets `PATH`. There is **no pgvector** — migrations pass, the model-context assistant will not work.
3. `cp .env.example .env`, set `DB_ENCRYPTION_KEY` to `$(head -c32 /dev/urandom | base64)`.
4. `bun run seed:admin -- --email x@y.z` — runs the migrations. It **ignores the email** and creates `admin@admin.com` / `administrator`.
5. `setsid nohup bun run dev > /var/tmp/dev.log 2>&1 < /dev/null &` then poll `curl localhost:3000/api/health` for 200. Add `AUTH_LOGIN_MAX_PER_MINUTE=100 AUTH_REGISTER_MAX_PER_MINUTE=100` when Playwright will register users, or registration answers 429 after three.

## Drive it (agent path)

There is no `chromium-cli` here; `driver.mjs` (Playwright, headless, signs in as the seeded admin) is the way to see a page. Paths are relative to the repository root.

```bash
node .claude/skills/run-modelling-tool/driver.mjs /projects /var/tmp/projects.png
node .claude/skills/run-modelling-tool/driver.mjs "/projects/{id}/logic" /var/tmp/logic.png \
  --new-project language/examples/crm.eml.mmd --wait 5000
node .claude/skills/run-modelling-tool/driver.mjs /projects/<id>/logic /var/tmp/x.png --click "Lead Qualification"
```

It prints the project id, final URL, the page's `h1` and the screenshot path; then read the PNG. `--new-project` creates a project from a model file as the signed-in account and fills `{id}`. Env: `BASE_URL`, `TOOL_EMAIL`, `TOOL_PASSWORD`, `PLAYWRIGHT_CHROMIUM_PATH`. For multi-step editor flows use the spec harness instead (`rule-editor-e2e` skill).

## Things that bite

- **A project is reachable only by its owner.** A 404 on `/api/projects/:id/eml` (page stuck on a load error) means the id belongs to another account — use `--new-project`.

- **Background processes die between tool calls** (Postgres and the dev server both). Re-check `pg_isready -h /tmp` and the health URL before a long script; restart with the lines above. Never `pkill -f` a pattern your own command line contains — it kills the shell.
- After a dependency or config change Vite re-optimises and reloads the page once; a script that clicks during that gets a "Something went wrong" overlay. Wait for `.jdm-scope .react-flow` (the rule editor) rather than a fixed sleep.
- Chromium is at `/opt/pw-browsers/chromium` (headless only — there is no display). Launch Playwright with `executablePath: "/opt/pw-browsers/chromium"`.
- The container's proxy denies most hosts. Anything fetched from a CDN fails; the app itself must not need one.
- Import a model through the UI: **Import a model** opens a modal with a hidden `input[type=file]` — wait for it to attach, `setInputFiles`, then press the modal's Import button.

## Where things are

Projects list `/projects` · Logic step `/projects/:id/logic` (rules and workflows) · Enhance `/projects/:id/enhance` then `/enhance/<Entity>Service` (hooks, Trigger.dev workflows, Business Rules).
